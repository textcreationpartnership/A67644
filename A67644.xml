            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>IT is now more than Ten Years ſince this Book was firſt publiſhed: and althô very few Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of it could be then conveyed into <hi>England,</hi> by reaſon of the trouble, (which gives occaſion for this ſecond Edition) yet one came to Dr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net's</hi> Hands; who having read it, ſaid, <hi>He was reſolved to have nothing to do with its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</hi> Theſe words may proceed as well from a low eſteem, as otherwiſe; ſo they did not alter my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Book it ſelf, which I leave to the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Judgment. I called it <hi>Anti-Haman,</hi> from ſome reſemblance betwixt <hi>Haman</hi> the <hi>Macedonian</hi> in an Eaſtern Court, and Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> in this Weſtern; yet I could not foreſee, that the Paralel would go ſo far, as ſince it has done, even to ſet <hi>G. B.</hi> fair for compleating the laſt Scene of that Factious Stranger.</p>
            <p>I follow in my Anſwer <hi>Dr. B.</hi> Step by Step: and to ſhew that I neither alter his Senſe, nor diſſemble the Strength of his Reaſons, I give them in his own words. I ſtudied to be as ſhort as I could; (yet I hope I ſay enough to ſatisfie an indifferent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) only in ſome few places I have enlarged, the thing there treated being in a new Dreſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring it.</p>
            <p>Such is the Accuſation of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> brought in
<pb facs="tcp:106095:3"/>againſt the Catholic Church, by the old and new <hi>Iconoclaſts,</hi> but by Dr. <hi>Edw. Stillingfleet</hi> ſo much changed, that it is quite another thing. The firſt of our late Reformers accuſed us of uſing Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and giving to them a Religious Worſhip, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that which the Idolaters gave to their Idols: yet they owned this difference, that Images were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced only for Honor due to God, or his Friends, the <hi>Saints:</hi> whereas the <hi>Pagans</hi> in them adored <hi>Dead Men,</hi> or <hi>Living Devils,</hi> that is, <hi>Falſe Gods.</hi> (See <hi>Calvin, l. 1. Inſt. c. 11. n. 9.</hi>) Now Dr. <hi>E. S.</hi> will have the <hi>Pagan Jupiter,</hi> to have been the <hi>True God,</hi> the other <hi>Pagan Deities</hi> to have been either Names of his <hi>Attributes,</hi> or <hi>Spirits Mediating</hi> berwixt the <hi>Supreme God,</hi> and <hi>Men.</hi> An Error ſo new, that I ſcarce believe any one <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> before him, ever held it, and therefore it may be called, the <hi>Stillingfleetian Error.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it, it is enough to read any of thoſe <hi>Fathers,</hi> who wrote againſt <hi>Pagans, Tertullian,</hi> or <hi>Juſtin, Athenagoras,</hi> or <hi>Minutius, Lactantius, S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, Arnobius,</hi> or <hi>Julius Firmicus:</hi> there being not one of all theſe, but convinces this groſs Error. But he little expected to be confuted out of any of theſe, by any Prieſt, having aſſured, that none of us read more, than <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and <hi>Coccius.</hi> Which is not the only raſh Aſſertion found in his Works.</p>
            <p>Were this Doctrin true, the whole Debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> were at an end, and the Cauſe yielded to the later. For the <hi>Pagans</hi> ſaid <hi>Jupiter</hi> was the <hi>True God:</hi> The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſaid he was not the <hi>True God,</hi> but was
<pb facs="tcp:106095:3"/>a <hi>Man, Born, Dead,</hi> and <hi>Buried,</hi> as other Men What ſays Dr. <hi>E S. Jupiter</hi> was the <hi>True God</hi> Here we ſee, the whole Body of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the four firſt Ages, all the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> the <hi>Doctors,</hi> the <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> and ſo many <hi>Apoſtolical Men</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, as denying the <hi>True God,</hi> and that by one, who profeſſes himſelf a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and a <hi>Doctor of Divinity,</hi> and <hi>Champion of the Reformed Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe Primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> went farther yet, they not only denied him to be <hi>God,</hi> but accuſed him of grievous Crimes, of <hi>Adultery,</hi> of <hi>Inceſt,</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> againſt his own Father, and of other moſt <hi>unnatural Sins;</hi> which are ſo many horrid Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, if <hi>Jupiter</hi> be the <hi>True God.</hi> And which is yet worſe, all thoſe Bleſſed Martyrs continued to their laſt Breath in them, and ſealed them with their Blood. What will, what can Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſay to this? And what can a <hi>Chriſtian Reader</hi> judge of him?</p>
            <p>In fine, this bold Aſſertion of <hi>E. S.</hi> and ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of the new Stamp, is contrary to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who Planted <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> oppoſit to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and all <hi>Pagan Deities;</hi> contrary to the <hi>Glorious Martyrs,</hi> who watered it with their Blood; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> who defended it with their Writings; contrary to the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> which profeſſed it amidſt the ſevereſt Perſecutions, and Torments; contrary to <hi>God,</hi> who confirmed it with Miracles; and contrary to that ſame very <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf, who owned himſelf to be a <hi>filthy ſeducing Devil.</hi> What can the Learned World
<pb facs="tcp:106095:4"/>judge of ſo raſh an Aſſertion? What will he ſtop at, who, to oppoſe <hi>Popery,</hi> will contradict all the firſt Ages of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and God himſelf? What credit can he deſerve in obſcurer Points of <hi>Divinity,</hi> who, in ſo clear a <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> dares contradict all <hi>Antiquity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope he will open his Eyes, acknowledge his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and give Glory to <hi>God,</hi> by renouncing that <hi>Arch-Devil:</hi> otherwiſe it may be written on his Tomb, <hi>Here lieth</hi> E. S. <hi>who owned no other God, but the Pagan Jupiter.</hi> This Epitaph will be very Honorable to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> in which he makes ſo great a Figure.</p>
            <p>There was publiſhed lately a Treatiſe, in which the <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as found in <hi>Scripture,</hi> is very Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, and Solidly Explicated. Some fancied a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement in our Sentiments, becauſe that Honorable Perſon ſays, the <hi>Pagan Deities were Stars,</hi> and I ſay, <hi>they were Men.</hi> Yet in this there is no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction at all: for he explicates that <hi>Idolatry</hi> which is mentioned in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and reigned in the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> and he adds, that the <hi>Greeks,</hi> to get the reputation of <hi>Antiquity</hi> to their Nation, cut off the Heads of thoſe <hi>Idols,</hi> and ſet on them others of their <hi>Kings;</hi> that is, they retained the Gods, but called them by the Names of ſuch as have been famous amongſt them either for Regal Power, or for War, or for invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome uſeful Arts. And it is known to all the World, that the chiefeſt <hi>Gods</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> were taken from the <hi>Greeks.</hi> Now that I confined my ſelf to the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> is evident: for Chap. <hi>7.</hi> Sect. <hi>3.</hi> pag. <hi>52.</hi> I ſay,
<pb facs="tcp:106095:4"/>
               <hi>Our only Diſpute is about the</hi> Greeks, <hi>and</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, <hi>whoſe</hi> Idolatry <hi>was baniſhed the World by</hi> Chriſtian Religion. And Sect. <hi>5.</hi> pag. <hi>83. Our Diſpute is not of the firſt Beginners, and Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of</hi> Idolatry; <hi>but of thoſe who lived at, and ſince the time of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>till</hi> Chriſtianity <hi>prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> But in my <hi>Reviſion</hi> of <hi>D. M.</hi> his Second Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, pag. <hi>122.</hi> I diſtinguiſh theſe two ſorts of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> and give the precedency in <hi>Time</hi> to <hi>Star-Worſhip. Primum omnium Stellas &amp; admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioni fuiſſe propter pulchritudinem, &amp; venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oni propter utilitatem. Hinc Sap. XIII. pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo refertur, &amp; refutatur Aſtrorum Adoratio; deinde Idolorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Althô it be hard to foreſee when theſe contentious Diſputes will end, (<hi>Paſſion,</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> fighting againſt <hi>Truth</hi>) yet I do not deſpair; that ſome alive may be ſo happy as to ſee it: For many Objections againſt us are grounded on Miſtakes; others are not againſt <hi>Faith,</hi> (which alone we are bound to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend) but <hi>Diſcipline.</hi> Such is the <hi>Free uſe of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in the Vulgar Language, prohibited by the Council of</hi> Trent, ſays Dr. <hi>E. S.</hi> in his <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of</hi> Trent <hi>Examin'd, and Diſprov'd by</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Tradition. And then in a long elaborate Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, with many Examples of ancient Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Scripture, he endeavors to prove, there is no <hi>Catholic Tradition</hi> for that <hi>Prohibition.</hi> Againſt whom is this? I acknowledge I am to ſeek. For, <hi>1.</hi> We pretend <hi>Catholic Tradition</hi> for Points of <hi>Faith,</hi> not for each Point of <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi> of which this is one. <hi>2.</hi> This Point is not
<pb facs="tcp:106095:5"/>univerſally received in the Church, as may be ſeen pag. <hi>26.</hi> of this <hi>Edition. 3.</hi> I find no ſuch <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition</hi> in the <hi>Council of Trent.</hi> This <hi>Council</hi> did order, Seſſ. <hi>18.</hi> an <hi>Index</hi> to be made of <hi>Suſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> or <hi>Pernicious Books,</hi> by a Committee of ſome of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> who, Seſſ. <hi>25.</hi> reported what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs was made in it. But the <hi>Council</hi> left the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of what was by them done, to the Pope, without any other Decree: and immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. Whence I gather, <hi>1.</hi> The <hi>Scripture</hi> in no <hi>Vulgar Language</hi> was conſider'd in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, or Committee, it never having been looked on either as <hi>Pernicious,</hi> or <hi>Suſpected</hi> by the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> or any <hi>General Council. 2. Scripture</hi> in a <hi>Vulgar Language</hi> was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the <hi>Council,</hi> for the <hi>Council</hi> left all that Matter to the Pope's Determination. <hi>3.</hi> The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex</hi> finiſhed in <hi>Rome,</hi> was never propoſed to the <hi>Council,</hi> an end being put to it immediately after that Reference of the <hi>Index</hi> to the <hi>Pope:</hi> ſo the <hi>Index</hi> is no Act of the <hi>Council.</hi> By which it appears, that the Learned Doctor in all that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, diſputes againſt no <hi>Catholic Doctrin,</hi> nor againſt the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi> Now this fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Phantôms, and then combating them, may amuſe the People for a time; but it will ſoon be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant, and therefore laid aſide.</p>

                     <hi>He that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth Knowlege, increaſeth Sorrow,</hi> is an obſervation which holdeth true of no part of Knowledge, ſo much as of the Knowlege of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: it is ſome relief to him, who knows nothing of foreign Wickedneſs, to hope there are other Nations wherein Vertue is honored, and Religion is in eſteem, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays his regrets when he ſees Vice, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety abound in his Country; but if by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling or reading, he enlarge his Horizon, and know Mankind better, his regrets will grow, when he finds the whole World lies in Wickedneſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> We need not travel, or read much, to know, that <hi>the whole World lies in Wickedneſs:</hi> Seeing thoſe are the Words of the beloved Diſciple. 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 5.19. This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an occaſion of Sorrow. But in the ſame place the B. Apoſtle comforts us, by ſaying,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106095:6"/>
                  <hi>We know that we are of God.</hi> So that the <hi>World</hi> there, is underſtood of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers;</hi> who are in <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> by original and actual Sin, for which they have no lawful, and efficacious Expiation, no Sacrament inſtituted by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God lawfully adminiſtred. But we, who are in the true Church, <hi>are of God,</hi> unto whom we are regenerated by Baptiſm; and if by humane frailty, we die to God, falling into any grievous Sin, we have the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Penance to raiſe us again to the Life of Grace.</p>
               <p>Yet it is not the Apoſtles meaning, that in the true Members of the Catholic Church there is nothing reprehenſible; or that in thoſe who are not in it, there is nothing Good. In Heaven there is nothing but Vertue, thoſe Bleſſed Souls having their will ſo united to that of God, that they cannot offend him. In Hell there is nothing but Sin; the Wills of thoſe wretched Spirits being ſo obſtinate in the Love of themſelves, that they cannot do any thing which ſhould pleaſe God. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Life is a mean betwixt thoſe Extreams: and in it there is a mixture of Perfections atd Imperfections, of Vice and Vertue. Thoſe, who are moſt wicked have ſomething good: and in thoſe, who are moſt vertuous, there are ſome remainders of Human Frailty, for their Humiliation which we ought neither to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, nor imitate.<note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Kings 21.25.</note> 
                  <hi>There was none like unto Achab, which did ſell

                  <hi>there was given to him a thorn in the fleſh, the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of Satan to buffet him.</hi> And who can without Compaſſion read his Seventh Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> in which he deſcribes the conflict he felt interiourly, betwixt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and the Fleſh? Which he concludes with theſe pathetick Words: <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> Which renew the memory of that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to which <hi>Mezentius</hi> the Tyrant<note n="(c)" place="margin">Virgilius Aeneid. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> condemn'd his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Subjects: And the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſcans</hi>

But the Apoſtle, who deſcribes his Pain, relates his Eaſe, and having explicated his Sickneſs, acquaints us with its Remedy, <hi>The grace of God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> So that if the Combat affrights us, by this Aſſiſtance we may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd and comforted.</p>
               <p>Yet tho I grant, that there is occaſion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough to lament on what ſide ſoever we caſt our eyes on Mankind, in this State of corrupt nature, if we conſider how little Men uſe the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106095:7"/>means deſigned for their Improvement in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and reſiſting their bad Inclinations. Yet there is little appearance of Grief in your Book; which hath more of a <hi>Satyr</hi> than of a <hi>Lamentation,</hi> your Stile being rather bitingly invective, than mourningly compaſſionate: you diſcover more of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> or of <hi>Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> than of <hi>Heraclitus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Were there no Objects of <hi>regret</hi> nearer home? Doth your own Church afford you no occaſion to ſhew your Zeal, in blaming the Faults of her Children, in order to get them corrected? Sure it doth, or the World is very much miſinformed. How comes it then, that you neglect her Cure, of whom your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter obliges you to have a Care, and ſearch the Sores of the Roman Church, with which you have nothing to do? Do you not ſee that you give us Reaſon to ſay, your Charity is diſorderly, not beginning at home, and that<note n="(a)" place="margin">Luke 6.42.</note> as the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crit, you labor to ſhew in, or take out of <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others eye, a mote,</hi> while you neglect <hi>a beam</hi> in your own?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> What <hi>temper</hi> then doth it <hi>argue</hi> to <hi>delight</hi> in repreſenting them, and that in the moſt horrible, tragical, and diſmal colours, which Art and Study can invent? For what can even the moſt inventive Imagination fancy more
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106095:7"/>diſmal, that what you write Pag. 2. <q>Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities done to God, and his Son Chriſt: the Enemy of Mankind triumphing over the World with abſolute Authority, and enraged Cruelty: Satan having a Seat, where Chriſts Throne ſhould be: Chriſtendom fallen from its firſt Love, and the greateſt part of it made ſhipwreck of its Faith: That Church, whoſe Faith was once ſpoken of throughout the World, become Mother of the Fornications of the Earth. <hi>In fine,</hi> Falling away, Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Iniquity, Antichriſt, Babiloniſh Rome, Bewitching Sorceries: And what not.</q> Add but Obſtinacy in theſe horrid Crimes (which is a Circumſtance aggravating them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out altering their Species) and the Pains due to Sin (which are not horrible, if compared with Sin) and we here have a Picture of Hell.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>temper</hi> is very <hi>merciful</hi> and <hi>humane,</hi> which prompts you to make ſuch a Map of the far greateſt part of Chriſtianity! This will appear more clearly, when we come to conſider your Charge in retail, and examin your Proofs, when we ſee you are forced to ſeek them in the obſcure withdrawing-roomes of Mans heart, which are inacceſſible to all, but God; of which nevertheleſs you ſpeak as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, as if God had led you by the Hand into them, and made you Partaker of his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. <q>Purgatory was invented on deſign to enrich the Clergy: Tranſubſtantiation on deſign to make it more eſteemed: The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy

Nay you not only fain Proofs for our Doctrins, but fix on us Doctrins them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which we diſown, as that we teach to break the Commandments.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Do you then think it as neceſſary to know <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> as to know <hi>Chriſt,</hi> That you expreſs your earneſtneſs in enquiring after Antichriſt in thoſe Words<note n="(a)" place="margin">Luke 7.19.</note> of S. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi>'s Inqueſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Meſſias?

               </p>
               <p>We are warn'd indeed of Antichriſt, and we are alſo warn'd of the Danger hanging over the Church, from<note n="(a)" place="margin">Mar. 13.21.22.</note> 
                  <hi>falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and falſe Chriſts.</hi> Who ſhould ſay, <hi>Lo here is Chriſt, Lo he is there.</hi> All Sectaries pretend to him. You will doubtleſs ſay, he is in your Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Church: The Presbyterian ſays, he is in his Aſſemblies: The Independent is for his Conventicles: The Quaker claims him alſo. What ſhall a Roman Catholic do? what choice ſhall he make? Our bleſſed Savior having forewarned us of the Danger, arms us againſt it: <hi>Ne credideritis, Believe none of them;</hi> but ſtick to the old Doctrin, and the Catholic Church. Which I cite, as more againſt you, than any thing, you can bring againſt us, out of your Contemplations on <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> or the <hi>Apocalypſe:</hi> to which you would never recur, had you any clear grounds againſt us in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. I ſuſpect the cauſe of any man, which to decide a Suit in Law, produces obſcure, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious, and (for that reaſon) inſignificant <hi>deeds.</hi> I ſhould on that ſcore, had others been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuſpect the Cauſe of the Sectaries, Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, Fifth-monarchy-men, and the like. And that reaſon is ſufficient to make me ſuſpect
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106095:9"/>you, who recur to thoſe obſcure Prophecies of the Antichriſt: which at beſt are extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſcure: as appears by the Errors ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on it, as you acknowledg: For you ſay,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. B.</hi> Pag. 3. <q>Some have ſtretched the Notion of Antichriſtianiſm ſo far, that things harmleſs and innocent, come within its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs: and others have too much contracted it, that they might ſcape free.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It ſeems the limits of the <hi>notion of Antichriſtianiſm</hi> are very arbitrary, ſeeing they are extended, or contracted according (not to Scripture, or Tradition, but) to the Fancy and Caprichio of every pragmatical Head. When you conſider more impartially the <hi>things harmleſs and innocent,</hi> which you blame in us as Antichriſtian, very probably, you will find your ſelf to be of the number of thoſe, who ſtretch its Notion beyond its nature, and thoſe limits, which God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. B.</hi> Pag. 3. <q>Antichriſtianiſm is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a bare Contradiction to ſome branches, or parts of the Goſpel; but a deſign and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire complex, of ſuch Opinions and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as are contradictory to, and ſubverſive of, the Power and Life of Chriſtianity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Never did <hi>Junior Sophiſter</hi> amongſt illiterate Peſants, deliver his Sentiments, or <hi>Apollo</hi> amongſt his deluded Adorers, ſpeak his Oracles, more magiſterially, than you deliver your Opinions in controverted Matters of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106095:9"/>Faith: For ſuch is this Point, ſeeing it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd in Scripture. and there are ſuch vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Perſwaſions concerning its true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as you your ſelf ſaid even now. You give us a new Notion of it, and what Scripture, what Tradition, what Decree of a Council, what Father, do you allege for it? None, not ſo much as any reaſon offer'd. Is not this to Lord it over the Faith of your Reader? To beg the thing in Queſtion, and to expect the World ſhould be ſo ſtupid, as to be taken with ſuch a Slight, that you ſhould meet with Belief, becauſe you boldly aſſert?</p>
               <p>To your bare Aſſertion, I will oppoſe my Negation: and why ſhould not my Negation be of as much weight, as your Affirmation? Eſpecially ſeing I ſpeak with all thoſe, whom you blame for enlarging, or contracting too much the Notion of Antichriſtianiſm, and you ſtand alone. I confirm my Negation with Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4.3. where thoſe are ſaid to be Antichriſts who <hi>denie Chriſts coming in the fleſh.</hi> Which is only one article of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, howſoever it be of the moſt funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental.</p>
               <p>Yet let us grant, what you ſo confidently beg, that Antichriſtianiſm is a complex of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions oppoſite to the Power and Life of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. I know none, who hath a better Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to it, than your Reformation: For the Life of Chriſtianity, is <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> and you have deſtroy'd the firſt by <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106095:10"/>the ſecond by <hi>Schiſm,</hi> as ſhall be proved here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Children delight in edged Tools, which ſerve only to cut their fingers; and you, and your Brethren, uſe weapons againſt us, which wound your ſelves. Fatal Experience might have taught you more Diſcretion, than to be ſtill moving that ſtone, which hath once cruſh'd both your Church and State to pieces.</p>
               <p>And truly the Reproach of Antichriſtian will fall on your Church, if prov'd againſt ours. For ſay what you pleaſe of the ancient <hi>Britans,</hi> the firſt Apoſtles of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who brought us the light of Faith, and planted the Goſpel amongſt us, came from <hi>Rome.</hi> The Hierarchy you pretend to, came from thence: By Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the Pope, my Lord of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> is Primate, and my Lord of <hi>London</hi> is his Suffragan. By the ſame Authority the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is divided into Dioceſes, your Deans and Chapters ſetl'd, your Univerſities founded, and ſeveral Degrees inſtituted in them. If the Pope be the <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> both Univerſities, and Hierarchy amongſt you is Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
               <p>Moreover the Livings you enjoy, were for the moſt part, if not altogether, given by the pious Liberality of Perſons, who profeſt that Faith we profeſs, and lived and died in the Communion of our Church. Gratitude to ſuch Benefactors may teach you to judge leſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, to ſuſpend your Judgment, till you
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106095:10"/>have more convincing Arguments to ground it on, than your own <hi>bare and bold Aſſertion.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This is indeed a <hi>Deſign</hi> worthy of <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> but imperfectly explicated by you, ſeeing you omit the <hi>love of God,</hi> the <hi>God</hi>

The ſecond, to divide us among our ſelves. Both are the effects of Sin: and nothing can prevent them, and link us together in the Bonds of Charity but he who can remit Sins.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Peace</hi> then, which Chriſtian Religion teaches, which the Church recommends to her Children, which in her Prayers ſhe demands of God, is not an effect of humane induſtry; but of Grace. It proceeds from the Mercy of God,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106095:13"/>it is a ſequel of Purity of Conſcience, and the Crown of real, and true Juſtice. In fine it is the work of the <hi>unſpotted Lamb,</hi>

               <p>You ſee, Sir, how inſufficient your Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Peace is for the end you propoſe.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Are theſe the only, or even the chief <hi>Characters</hi> of Divine Truths, whether you take them, as they are delivered <hi>in holy Writ,</hi> or as taught in the Church? Can you find no other quality peculiar to them, not common to others? Then human Learning may equal, if not ſurpaſs Divine. Take for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106095:15"/>ſome Principles naturally known, as <hi>Two and two make four:</hi> or, <hi>The whole Body is greater than any part of it.</hi> Theſe are <hi>true,</hi> it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they ſhould be falſe: they are <hi>perſpicuous</hi> and <hi>eaſie,</hi> no Man can doubt of them, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the terms. They are <hi>reaſonable:</hi> For what more reaſonable than to aſſent to evident Truth? Nay if we compare them with ſupernatural Truths, as to their <hi>Perſpicuity</hi> and <hi>Verity,</hi> in order to us, the Advantage ſeems greater on the ſide of <hi>natural Truths.</hi> 1. For no Man ever doubted of the Truth of theſe, having once underſtood their terms; and many have and do doubt of Faith, altho ſufficiently propos'd. And <hi>2ly</hi> no Man ever diſſented from thoſe Principles, when he had once admitted them, and many have A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatized from their Faith.</p>
               <p>So that all the Praiſes you give to Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long more to natural Sciences, then to it; ſuch a ſtranger are you to its true Prerogatives.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this ſtupendious Blindneſs in ſearching the Scriptures, is that you read them as a Maſter, not as a Diſciple; you intend not to learn from them what to believe, but to ſhape them to what you think: you have the Word, but reject the Sence; which is to the Word, what the Soul is to the Body, it gives it Life and Motion. <hi>The</hi>

               <p>No Books of the <hi>Sybills,</hi> nor Oracles of the Devils, or other humane Writing can equal Divine Scripture in this point.</p>
               <p>Another Character of Divine Scriptures is, the force which accompanies them, and works upon the heart of thoſe who are well diſpoſed, which inſinuates it ſelf into the Will, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames it with the Love of God, breaking in pieces the ſtony heart of Sinners. <hi>Are</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>That the Scriptures were written by plain and ſimple men,</hi> is not true; was <hi>Moſes</hi> ſuch, who was learned in all the Learning of the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans?</hi> Was <hi>David</hi> the ſweet ſinger of <hi>Iſrael, a plain and ſimple man?</hi> What ſhall we ſay of <hi>Solomon,</hi> to whoſe wonderful knowledge the Scripture it ſelf bears witneſs? <hi>Amos,</hi> it is true was; but <hi>Eſaias</hi> was not, nor <hi>Daniel,</hi> nor <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel.</hi> And whoever was Author of the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> he was certainly far from being <hi>plain and ſimple:</hi> For in him are found in perfection, Philoſophy, Aſtrology, and Divinity as a Queen governing them; and if <hi>Cauſſinus</hi> the Jeſuit may be believ'd, as compleat Rhetorick, as in any
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106095:17"/>whoſoever. And as to the Authors of the new Teſtament, as long as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> are amongſt them, you will never perſwade the learned part of the World, that your Speech is not raſh and inconſiderate.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe it true, that they were all <hi>plain and ſimple men,</hi> what then? Doth it follow that what they writ, is eaſie to the meaneſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city?

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This is a Calumny. We all una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly own Scripture to be the Word of God: that no Untruth can be found in it. Out of its <hi>Darkneſs and Ambiguity</hi> we ſhew the neceſſity of receiving its Senſe from Tradition; and not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106095:18"/>ſticking to the bare Letter of the Scripture without the Senſe; which is to the Letter, what a Soul is to the Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. B. Pag.</hi> 15. <q>We complain of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture being two much peruſed.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>G. B. Pag.</hi> 15. <q>Let as little of it be in Vulgar Tongues, as can be.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> A Third Calumny. It is all in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, tranſlated by the <hi>Rhemiſh</hi> and <hi>Doway</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges; and in French, by the Doctors of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain.</hi> And as for the New Teſtament, it is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd in French by <hi>Rene Benoit, Brulot, Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loin,</hi> and <hi>Amelot.</hi> Beſides other Editions leſs noted. And if there hath been no new Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation in Engliſh, it is not for any Decrees forbidding it, but becauſe that firſt Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is liked in groſs, and if any thing be defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive (as is unavoidable in all Works of Men) it is not conſiderable, and the like, or worſe may be fear'd in another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. B. Pag.</hi> 19. <q>We read it publickly in an unknown Tongue, in <hi>Latin.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> If this proves our Diſlike of the Scriptures, it will likewiſe prove our Diſlike of Councils and Popes Bulls, (which you ſay we prefer before Scriptures) ſeeing theſe were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver extant in any Vulgar Language. <hi>Latin</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:106095:18"/>cannot truly abſolutely be call'd <hi>An unknown Tongue,</hi> in the <hi>Latin Church,</hi> ſeeing it is the Language of her Schools, of her Public Service, of her Laws, of her Tribunals, of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and in many places (as in <hi>Polony,</hi> and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and lower <hi>Germany</hi>) of almoſt every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon, where very ordinarily even Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Watermen ſpeak it. And as for <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> with little application, they underſtand it, by reaſon of the Affinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their own, and the <hi>Latin Tongue.</hi> So <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> cannot abſolutely be ſaid to be an unknown Tongue, in <hi>Wales,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> tho' in both there are ſeveral who underſtand it not.</p>
               <p>If this be not a ſufficient Vindication of our Church, how will you excuſe your own from the ſame Fault, which never tranſlated the Scripture into <hi>Iriſh,</hi> but uſes <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> even where there are many thouſands who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it as little, as <hi>Latin</hi> is underſtood by any Catholic.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. B. Pag.</hi> 15. <q>We permit no private perſon the uſe of it, without Allowance from his Confeſſor.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> A Fourth Calumny. In <hi>Latin, Greek,</hi> or <hi>Hebrew,</hi> it is univerſally permitted to all. In <hi>France</hi> no Body ſcruples at the reading of it in <hi>French,</hi> provided the Editions be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Your Brethren there could have infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med you better: ſeeing they have had the Confuſion to ſee their Miniſters mouths ſtopt, by Cutlers and Shoemakers out of their own
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106095:19"/>Bible: which could not be, had they not read it.</p>
               <p>If the Opinion of a <hi>Confeſſor</hi> be demanded, it is to know the Diſpoſition of the perſon who deſires it, whether it be ſuch as good may be hoped from that reading. All Food is deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Almighty God for the uſe of Man; yet without any Injury to the Patient, a Phyſitian may forbid him the uſe of ſome, which would nouriſh peccant Humors. So Scriptures are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for our Inſtruction unto Piety to God, and Peace to our Neighbors: If any mans mind be poſſeſt with Opinions contrary to both, and theſe Opinions controul all Inſtruction given him, ſo as all ſerve only to confirm him in his impiety, and turbulent Humor, would you not adviſe him a Diet, from ſuch ſtrong Food, as Scripture? For Example, lately a great part of the Commonalty of our Nation was ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt with a Spirit of Rebellion againſt Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical and Civil Government, that altho there be ſcarce any thing more recommended in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writ, than Obedience to Prelate, and Prince, yet they thought the whole Drift of Scripture abetted their Treaſon: not that any ſuch thing was to be found in Scripture; but that they fancied it there, as Men fancy, that the Bells ſpeak articulate Words. In that conjuncture what Advice would you give to an Ignorant Man? to be ſatisfied with Books of Devotion, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions drawn from Scripture which might keep him humble and peaceable: or to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106095:19"/>reading the Scriptures which he thought preached Sedition, and from which (through his bad Diſpoſition) he was confirmed in his Rebellions, and Antichriſtan Courſes?</p>
               <p>Another motive, why the Confeſſors Advice is demanded, is that he might inſtruct Men how to Read, and reap Benefit from the Reading. To Read with the Humility of a Scholer, not the Preſumption of a Maſter; to make rather a Prayer, than a Study of it: To reſolve to practiſe what they underſtand, and adore God for what they underſtand not. So that whether they do, or do not, comprehend what they read, they glorifie God in all, and grow in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. After ſuch Inſtructions, apply'd to the Condition of every one, the Benefit will be much greater, and the danger of ill uſing it much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106095:21"/>and place them orderly according to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dignities by reaſon of their Matter or Art. On the firſt Rank he ſhould place thoſe of Gold; on the ſecond thoſe of Silver; on the third thoſe of Ivory; on the fourth thoſe of Braſs, or Stone. And amongſt theſe he ſhould give the Preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to thoſe which were the Maſter-pieces of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Workmen, ſuch as <hi>Phidias, Alcumenes, Myron, Euphranor, &amp;c.</hi> There <hi>Neptune</hi> ſees with diſdain and Indignation, <hi>Anubis</hi> with his dogs face take place of him, becauſe he was compos'd of more rich matter.

Graecor. affect. p. 634. <hi>Si fateri ipſi non vultis— If you</hi> (O Pagans) <hi>will not own it, yet it is known to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who have ſeen brought to light your Gods, which
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106095:23"/>you had hidden under ground, which ſome out of Devotion to them, for their ſecurity, had buried: others diſcovered where they were hidden, that being expos'd to publick view, Women and Children might ſcorn your Gods. They were the likeneſſes of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and Four-footed Beaſts, Bats and Mice which you adored: and altho you killed the Beaſts themſelves, Serpents, Scorpions, Mice and Batts, yet you adored their Statues as Gods.</hi>

                  <p>A fourth Reaſon is taken from the Prayers which were made to the Statues, or Idols. In the Book<note n="(a)" place="margin">Sap. 13.17.</note> of <hi>Wiſdom. He,</hi> the Idolater, <hi>maketh Prayer for his Good, for his Wife and Children, and is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſpeak to that which hath no life. For Health he calleth upon that which is weak; for Life he prayeth to that which is Dead; for Aid he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeecheth that which hath leaſt means to help; and for a good Journey, he asketh that, of that which cannot ſet a foot forward. And for gaining and getting, and good Succeſs of his hands, asketh abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to do, of him that hath leaſt ability to do any thing. Again one preparing to ſail, and about to paſs through the raging waves, calls upon a piece of wood more rotten than the wood which carrieth him.</hi> And in the Epiſtle of <hi>Hieremy.</hi>
                     <note n="(b)" place="margin">Bar. 6.41.</note> 
                     <hi>If they ſee one dumb, they bring him, and intreat Bell that he may ſpeak, as tho he were able to underſtand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe two Books are held to be <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> by Proteſtants, of which I will not treat at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet why they ſhould denie them credit in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106095:23"/>a matter of fact, I know no Reaſon. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they regard not what is reaſonable in their Controverſies, but what ſerves their turn, I will ſhew the ſubſtance of all this, in Books of unqueſtionable Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:<note n="(a)" place="margin">Iſaias 44.17.</note> 
                     <hi>The reſidue of the Aſh he maketh a God, he falleth down unto it, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dores it, and prays unto it, and ſaith, deliver me, for thou art my God.</hi> The ſayings of the other Books are only Ampliations of this. So they cannot be denied, without rejecting this, nor this admitted without retaining of thoſe.</p>
                  <p>A fifth Reaſon is that the Idolaters were really perſwaded, that their Idols did help them. Hieremy,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Hier. 2.27.</note> 
                     <hi>Saying to a ſtock, thou art my Father, and to a ſtone, thou haſt begotten me.</hi> Certainly thoſe who could believe that they ought their Being, the greateſt of all Gifts, to their Statues or Idols, of Stone or Wood, would much eaſier believe they owed to them other goods of an inferior nature. Certainly the <hi>Jews</hi>
                     <note n="(c)" place="margin">Hier. 44.8.</note> aſcribed their paſt Felicity in <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eruſalem,</hi> to their Sacrifices offer'd to the Queen of Heaven, and their then preſent miſeries to their ceaſing from thoſe Sacrifices. But the moſt publick owning of ſingular Benefits from Idols, is that of the Iſraelites.<note n="(d)" place="margin">Exod. 32.4.</note> 
                     <hi>Theſe are thy Gods, O Iſrael, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt.</hi> Which words S. <hi>Cyril</hi> of Alexand. <hi>l.</hi> 9. <hi>contra Julia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num p.</hi> 308. <hi>B.</hi>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106095:24"/>underſtands to be ſaid to that very Calf, which <hi>Aaron</hi> had caſt.</p>
                  <p>If Mr. <hi>Still.</hi> think not this Reaſon cleared enough out of Scripture, I ſhall deſire him to read what is written by the <hi>Greeks</hi> of the <hi>Palladium</hi> of <hi>Troy,</hi> and what the <hi>Romans</hi> thought of it, and of their <hi>Ancilia,</hi> what <hi>Macrobius</hi> writes of ſome Nations, who chained the Gods, Protectors of their Cities, fearing they ſhould forſake them. Let him at leaſt read S. <hi>Auſtin l.</hi> 1. <hi>de Civit. c.</hi> 3. And if he cannot be convinced, that the Pagans had Confidence in their Statues, or Idols, I ſay he ſhuts the Eyes of his underſtanding ſo cloſe, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all light, but what pleaſes him, and ſerves his turn. Add to this, S. Cyprian l. ad Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trianum, <hi>Pudeat te eos colere quos ipſe defendis, pudeat tutelam de iis ſperare, quos tu ipſe tueris. Be aſhamed to worſhip thoſe, whom you defend: and to expect Protection from thoſe, who themſelves need yours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have two Authorities more, to confirm this Reaſon: <hi>Jeremy</hi>
                     <note n="(a)" place="margin">Hier. 10.5.</note> affords the firſt. <hi>They muſt be carried, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot go: Wherefore fear them not, for they can neither do hurt, nor good.</hi> To what intent could this Reaſon be alleag'd, unleſs it were to confound that Opinion that the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues themſelves could help, or hinder? The Pagans then were poſſeſſ'd with that Opinion. My other is out of <hi>David</hi>
                     <note n="(b)" place="margin">Pſal. 113.8. <hi>or</hi> Pſ. 115.8.</note> who having ſaid that the Idols
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106095:24"/>of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were Silver and Gold, the work of Mens hands; that they had Eyes and could not ſee, Ears and could not hear, &amp;c. He concludes his elegant Induction, with theſe Words, <hi>May every one who makes them, be like unto them, and alſo all who truſt in them.</hi> There was then a Truſt, a Conſidence, a Reliance upon thoſe Idols, which could not be grounded, but on an Opinion that they did good. Add to this, what <hi>R. Majmonides</hi> ſays, as he is rendred by <hi>Dionyſius Voſſius p.</hi> 8. <hi>Ab his ſimulacris bona &amp; mala omnia provenire indicabant univerſis, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inde ſummo jure coli &amp; metui.</hi> And <hi>Athenago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> in his Embaſſy for Chriſtians. p. 25. owns the ſame, but atributes the effects to Spirits dwelling in them.</p>
                  <p>My laſt Reaſon is taken from the ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments produced in Scripture againſt Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that Idols were made by Men, that care muſt be taken they did not fall.<note n="(a)" place="margin">ſupra.</note>

                  <p>You will ſay Pagans were wiſe men: how could they then be capable of ſo groſs an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror? <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This is that weakneſs of the Underſtanding incident to ſome, who in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact require Demonſtrations: So a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106095:25"/>denied local Motion, becauſe he could not anſwer the Reaſons againſt it, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no other Confutation, But by this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Fool, what do I now,</hi> propoſed by a Man who walked. It is clear out of what I have ſaid, that the Pagans <hi>de facto</hi> did believe their Idols to be Gods, why ſhould we give ear to a ſpeculative Reaſon, againſt an evident hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Truth? As if Man left to himſelf, did nothing but rationally, or did not many times ſo far darken his Underſtanding, as to ſhew little uſe of it in his greateſt Concerns! It was the greateſt folly imaginable, I grant it, yet that is incident to Man, when he is abandoned of God. And this the Ingratitude of Philoſophers deſerved. For <hi>when</hi>
                     <note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom. 1.21.</note> 
                     <hi>they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations, and their fooliſh heart was darkened, profeſſing themſelves to be wiſe, they became fools, and changed the glory of an incorruptible God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Image.</hi> Thus S. <hi>Paul.</hi> If you reply, you ſee who you will diſpute againſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, S. Paul, Hieremy, Iſaias,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you ſtill think the Paralel juſt betwixt the Idolatry of Pagans, and the worſhip given in the Catholic Church to Images, skew your Art in Sophiſtry, and prove that we hold our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to <hi>be Gods,</hi> that we put our <hi>Confidence</hi> in them, expect Good or fear Evil from a Stock. How pitiful would your Diſcourſe be, ſhould
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106095:25"/>you diſpute againſt us in this manner: A Croſs is made by a Man, ergo, it is not a Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our Saviors Death. The Statue of our B. Lady cannot move without the help of Man, Ergo we are not to hope for any thing from God through her Interceſſion.</p>
                  <p>In fine, either what Fathers, and what Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture contains againſt the Idols of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, is to no purpoſe, and all their Reaſons are frivolous; or our Doctrin of Images differs from theirs of Idols: the Firſt is Blaſphemy, therefore you muſt ſubſcribe to the Second.</p>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106095:26"/>Wherefore, I cannot ſubſcribe to that Rabby, eſpecially ſeeing <hi>Enos</hi> was of the vertuous Branch, and ſurely ſuch a heinous Sin as <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> could not come but from curſed <hi>Cain,</hi> or his Poſterity; if there was any before they were deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>I rather incline to what S. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alex.</hi> ſays <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>contra Julianum:</hi> That there was no Idolatry before the Deluge; becauſe no Author mentions any, nor after the Deluge, till after building the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Tongues, for the ſame Reaſon. But ſhortly after thoſe Seeds were ſown, which in proceſs of time brought forth that bad Fruit. <hi>Suidas</hi> ſays that <hi>Seruch</hi> began <hi>Politheiſm</hi> and <hi>Idolatry: Conſtantinus Manaſſes</hi> lays the Fault on his Deſcendants, tho he gave the occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Our Bodies do not in a moment ſhoot up to their full Growth, but leaſurely, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner imperceptibly, and our Souls do neither on a ſudden raiſe themſelves to the height of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, nor fall into the Depth of hainous Sin, according to the ordinary courſe of Grace and Nature. <hi>Nemo repente fit ſummus.</hi> S. <hi>Bernard.</hi> (See S. <hi>Chryſoſt. bom.</hi> 87. <hi>in Matthaeum</hi>) For that one of a Perſecutor ſhould in a moment become an Apoſtle and a choſen Veſſel; another of an Apoſtle become a Divel, is very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary; The Firſt may be eſteemed a Miracle in the Order of Grace, which is all miraculous: the Second a Monſter in the Order of Sins, which is all monſtrous. Now Idolatry, being
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106095:26"/>the very height of Wickedneſs, Men by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degrees deſcended into it: Firſt they made Statues, Secondly gave them Civil Worſhip, then Religious Worſhip, and laſtly that Cult, or Worſhip, which is due to none but God.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Occaſion of making them, was for the Solace of Parents afflicted with the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Death of their dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved child.<note n="(a)" place="margin">Sap. 14.15.</note> 
                     <hi>A Father affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with untimely mourning when he had made an Image of his child taken away, now honored him as a God, which was then a dead Man, and deliver'd to thoſe that were under him, ceremonies and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</hi> S. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexand. l.</hi> 1. <hi>contra Julia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> delivers the ſame, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The Second was the Homage due to Kings by their Subjects. Thoſe who were within a certain diſtance from the Court, did it to the King in Perſon: But thoſe who dwelt in remote Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, performed that Duty to the Kings in their Statues, (as now they do it to them in their Commiſſioners, or Deputies) which Homage was at firſt only a Civil Worſhip, but ſoon
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106095:27"/>degenerated into Divine Adoration<note n="(a)" place="margin">Sap. 14.17.</note>

                  <p>Thus <hi>Nabuchodonoſor,</hi> thus the <hi>Roman Caeſars,</hi> thus ſeveral others came to be adored. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> could not obtain it of his <hi>Macedonians,</hi> yet of his new <hi>Perſian</hi> Subjects he obtained it.

                  <p>Probably this may be the Reaſon, wherefore altho by Gods command Statues<note n="(a)" place="margin">Exod. 25.18.</note> of Cherubins were made to be placed with the Ark in the Sanctuary, where none but Prieſts came, yet in the Courts of the Temple, either thoſe of the Jews, or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, there were none. To leave nothing in the ſight of that ſtiff-neckt, rebellious, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous People, which might be <hi>A ſtumbling block to their Souls, and a ſnare to their Feet.</hi> And ſuch would thoſe Statues have been to the Jews, as they had been to the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>The Proteſtants cannot blame the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Church, for having Statues, and expoſing them to the People openly, without blaming their own Church, in which Statues are in like manner made, and expoſed, as I have heard of ſeveral of their Cathedrals, namely that of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where upon the Font are thoſe of Chriſt, and his twelve Apoſtles. We think our People ſecured from the danger of Idolatry, Firſt by being taught that the Statues are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Repreſentations of Saints,</hi> and not <hi>Saints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> much leſs <hi>Gods.</hi> Secondly becauſe that religious Reſpect which we give to Images, doth by them end <hi>ultimatè</hi> in God: For why do we reſpect the Image or Statue? For the Saint it repreſents. And why do we reverence the Saint? Merely becauſe he was the Temple of God, and Inſtrument of the Holy Ghoſt. So that all our Worſhip of Images ends in God, and his Chriſt, with the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>one God
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106095:29"/>bleſſed for evermore.</hi> Thus we inſtructing the People, ſtop their Inclinations to the evil, <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> and by owning all we have, and all the Saint had, that <hi>is good from God,</hi> we hope we need not fear, that dreadful <hi>Blindneſs</hi> and <hi>Folly,</hi> into which the Men wiſe according to this World were permitted (to humble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them) to fall through a <hi>penal,</hi> but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>juſt Judgment of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt occaſion of this <hi>Idolatry,</hi> was the Devil inſinuating himſelf into the Statues, and in a manner dwelling in them, anſwering to Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions propoſed to them, cauſing Sickneſſes, and healing them, telling things which happen'd at a Diſtance, and pretending to foretell things to come; altho in this unleſs they were very cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in delivering their Oracles in obſcure terms, their Ignorance in future things was eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106095:29"/>thoſe who adored as God, ſeveral Creatures, either, for their Beauty or the Benefit, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them, ſuch as are the Fire, and ſome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, of the Earth, or the Sun, Moon, or Stars <hi>

                     <hi>are all men by nature, who are ignorant of God, and could not out of the good things ſeen, know him that is; neither by conſidering his works, did acknowledge the workmaſter: but deemed either fire, or the circle of the ſtars, or the lights of Heaven, to be Gods, which govern the World, with whoſe beauty, if they being delighted, took them to be Gods, let them know how much better the Lord of them is. But if they were aſtoniſh'd at their power and vertue, let them underſtand by them how much mightier he is, who made them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is yet another Species of Idolatry of ſuch, who Deified and Adored all Creatures, which was grounded on that Opinion of the Stoicks, that God was the Soul of the World, which is expreſt by <hi>Virgil:</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Spiritus intus alit, totamque infuſa per artus</l>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But nothing about this occurring in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and not much in Fathers, I let it paſs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the ſeveral Species of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which occur and are moſt conſpicuous amongſt <hi>Pagans.</hi> All were abſolutely inexcuſable, for leaving the Creator for the Creature. Yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all, methinks the cauſe of thoſe who adored the <hi>Sun,</hi> was ſomewhat more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable than the reſt; for altho Reaſon teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106095:30"/>it evidently not to be a <hi>God,</hi> yet Experience ſhews it to have one <hi>Property of God;</hi> for the <hi>Sun</hi> gives Light and Life to all that have Eyes and Heart, it gives without Intereſt, it never appears, but as a common good, and beſides its viſible effects, produces many other by hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Influences. Theſe Conſiderations do not excuſe, but they ſomewhat diminiſh the guilt of thoſe who adored that <hi>wonderful Inſtrument, the work of the moſt High.</hi> Eccleſiaſtici 43.2.</p>
                  <p>To ſum up what we have ſaid, we find that even the wiſeſt Men have been guilty of the greateſt Folly, that can enter into man's head, how weak ſoever, to take for a God, a thing ſo much inferiour to them in nature, that they expected help of a thing helpleſs, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from what is ſenſeleſs. To this they were diſpoſed by the humane Shape, ſtriking their fancy; they were moved to it by <hi>love</hi> of a dead Maſter, <hi>Fear</hi> of a living Tyrant, <hi>Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> to one, on whom their fortune depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and theſe altogether heightened by the <hi>Illuſion of the Divel.</hi> Sometimes <hi>Gratitude</hi> to beneficial Creatures, enclined Men to renounce the great Benefactor. Yet theſe motives how powerful ſoever, could never have made Men ſo prodigiouſly to renounce the uſe of Reaſon, had they not by former ſins, ſo far left God, as to deſerve to be left by him; not that they received no Grace at all from him, but that they had not ſuch Graces as would keep them in what was good, and prevent their fall into thoſe ſenſleſs Errors.</p>

                     <hi>SECTION III.</hi> What were the Gods of the Pagans? <hi>Or,</hi> What things were repreſented by their Idols? where it is proved, that Pagan Gods had been Men.</head>
                  <p>THE Occaſion I have to treat of this Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, is given by <hi>G. B.</hi> and <hi>E. Still.</hi> who pretend that Chiefly one and he <hi>the true God</hi> was adored by the <hi>Idolaters,</hi> who uſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Statues and Names, only to repreſent his ſeveral Atributes. And that by <hi>Jupiter</hi> they underſtood the <hi>true God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What I have cited out of Scripture, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is ſufficient to convince the contrary: ſeeing that it appears that dead Men, Stars, &amp;c. were adored. <hi>Voſſius l.</hi> 1. <hi>de Idol. cap.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 30. ſays, Idolatry began with the Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Angels, thence paſt to the Souls of Men. <hi>Lactantius l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 14. ſays, the Aegyptians firſt adored the Stars, afterward their Kings. S. <hi>Cyril.</hi> of <hi>Alex. l.</hi> 1. <hi>contra Jul. p.</hi> 17. ſaith the ſame of the <hi>Chaldaeans.</hi> But the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> lived amongſt them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored either <hi>Apis</hi> or <hi>Joſeph</hi> under the ſhape of an Ox, or Calf. And in imitation of them, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Deſert, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. and the ten Tribes at their Schiſm from the Temple of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> the third of <hi>Kings</hi> 12.28. which continued amongſt them, till they were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved quite out of the Country Altho that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106095:31"/>was not the only Idolatry they were guilty of: for they had <hi>Baal,</hi> 3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 18. <hi>and the hoſt of Heaven</hi> toward the end of their Kingdom, as appears 4 <hi>Reg.</hi> 17.16. which they learnt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably of the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> After the Tranſmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Tribe of <hi>Juda,</hi> we find thoſe who remained in their Country, much addicted to the Star-worſhip. <hi>Hieremy</hi> 44. as to a Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ancient amongſt them, which I gueſs they learnt of their King <hi>Achaz,</hi> and that he receiv'd it from <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> 4 <hi>Reg.</hi> 16. where a Copy of an Altar was ſent to the High-Prieſt to have another made like it, and placed in the Temple. But this being a matter of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I do not trouble my ſelf with further examining it. Our only Diſpute is about the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> whoſe Idolatry was baniſh'd the World by Chriſtian Religion, which our modern Adverſaries pretend that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed again.</p>
                  <p>You ſay then, that they by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> adored <hi>the true God, Creator of Heaven and Earth:</hi> we ſay that all the Gods of the Pagans were Men, and that <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf was ſuch; and that they were Divels who took upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thoſe perſons Names, to delude the World, I will prove this, <hi>1ſt.</hi> out of Scripture, <hi>2ly.</hi> out of ſuch Fathers as lived with Pagans, and conſequently had more occaſion to know their Theology, than we, who muſt gather it only out of their Writings, <hi>3ly.</hi> out of the Confeſſion of Pagans, <hi>4ly.</hi> out of the Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106095:31"/>of the Gods themſelves, who were adored, and laſtly by the Confeſſion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</p>
                  <p>My Firſt Proof is taken out of Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. (96.) 5. <hi>All the Gods of the nations are divels. Omnes Dii Gentium Daemonia.</hi> So it is in the vulgat Edition, and was ſo from the beginning, while Paganiſm ſlouriſh'd; and yet Pagans never accuſed the Chriſtians for impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon them Opinions, which they did not hold. See S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> upon that place. The Engliſh Tranſlation is ſomewhat different. <hi>viz. All the Gods of the Nations are Idols.</hi> Which notwithſtanding confutes ſufficiently the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Error: for if this be true, <hi>All Gods of Nations are Idols,</hi> as it muſt, being in Scripture: <hi>E. S.</hi> his Propoſition being contradictory to it, muſt be falſe, <hi>Jupiter the chief God of Nations, is no Idol, nor Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover if the Sacrifice the Idolaters of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, (which was always held to be the Prime Act of Religion) was offered by them to the Devils, and not to God, then it follows they did not worſhip the true God, but only Divels. But they ſacrificed to Divels, and not to God, Ergo they did not adore the true God, but Divels. I prove the Minor. <hi>Denter.</hi> 32.17. <hi>They ſacrificed to Divels, not to God: to gods whom they knew not, to new gods, who came new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up, whom your fathers feared not.</hi> Pſal. 105. (106) 37. <hi>They ſacrificed their ſons, and their Daughters unto Devils.</hi> And 1 Cor. 10.20. <hi>The
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106095:32"/>things which the Gentiles ſacrifice, they ſacrifice to Devils, and not to God.</hi> Hence Aug. l. 20. contra Fauſt. c. 18. ait. <hi>Nihil in ſacrificiis Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganorum Deo diſplicuiſſe, niſi quod fierent daemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is. Nothing in Sacrifices of the Pagans was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to God, but thoſe to whom they were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. viz.</hi> the Devils.</p>
                  <p>My Second Proof is taken out of thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who living with the Pagans, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing familiarly with their perſons, (ſome of them having been Pagans themſelves) and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt them had moſt reaſon to know their Sentiments concerning their Gods, and durſt not miſrepreſent them, for <hi>Fear of God,</hi> who forbids lying, <hi>and ſhame of men,</hi> who would have diſcovered their Falſhood. What ſay theſe Fathers of the Pagan Gods? <hi>Athenago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras legat. pro Chriſt. pag.</hi> 14. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. <hi>Are not the Ceremonies of the Aegyptians ridiculous who mourn for thoſe perſons, as for dead men, and adore and offer ſacrifice unto them, as to Gods.</hi> And pag. 16. He tells the Emperours, they knew very well, that the antient Poets <hi>Orpheus, Homer,</hi> and <hi>Heſiod,</hi> were either Contemporary with <hi>the Gods,</hi> or lived very little after them.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106095:33"/>Italy will afford convincing Arguments, in which after many Wars, and having paſt Greece, Saturn ſettled, being entertain'd by Janus: he gave his name to the city he built, to the mountain where he dwelt.

                  <p>I conclude this proof with the words of <hi>Juſtin M.

                  </p>
                  <p>My Third Proof is taken from the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Pagans; for <hi>Sanconiathon</hi> the ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of their writers, whoſe words you may find in S. <hi>Cyril. l.</hi> 1. <hi>contra Julianum pag.</hi> 205. And Mr. <hi>Stillingſt.</hi> in his <hi>Origines Sacrae p.</hi> 32. He, I ſay, taught that even the greateſt Gods had been Men.

                  <p>Alexander in a particular book ſent to his Mother, acquaints her, that he by threats had forced out of an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Prieſt, this ſecret, that all the Gods (which he with the reſt of the Pagans adored) had been men. This is cited

                  </p>
                  <p>This is confirmed by all thoſe, who name the ſeveral Countrys of their Gods, <hi>Jupiter</hi> of <hi>Crete, Mars</hi> of <hi>Thracia, Juno</hi> of <hi>Argos</hi> or <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, Diana</hi> of <hi>Taurica Cherſoneſus, Dercetus</hi> or <hi>Atergate</hi> a cruel and laſcivious woman (Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Semiramis</hi>) of <hi>Syria, Apollo, Venus,</hi> &amp;c. of other Countries.

                  <p>My Fourth Proof is taken from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of the Gods themſelves, whom the Pagans adored. Tertul.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106095:36"/>we will force that ſame Spirit which obſeſſes thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and blinds thy Soul with Ignorance of Gods Truth, to ſpeak the Truth to thee: thou ſhalt ſee thoſe pray to us, to whom thou offereſt thy Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thoſe to fear us, whom thou adoreſt. Thou ſhalt ſee thoſe tremble as captives, chained by us, whom thou honoreſt as Lords. Certainly thou wilt be aſhamed of thy Error, when thou heareſt thy Gods themſelves (when queſtioned by us) own what they are, even in your preſence, as not able to conceal their cunning wiles and illuſions.</hi>

                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:106095:38"/>ſays, <hi>That which of all ſeems cleareſt in this Theology, is the open owning the</hi> Original <hi>of</hi> Idolatry <hi>to have been from the Conſecration of ſome eminent</hi> Perſons <hi>after their</hi> Death <hi>who had found out ſome</hi> uſeful things <hi>for the</hi> world, <hi>whilſt they were</hi> living, <hi>which the ſubtiller</hi> Greeks <hi>would not admit of;</hi> viz. <hi>That the</hi> Perſons <hi>they worſhipped were once men, which made them turn all into</hi> Allegories, <hi>and</hi> myſtical Senſes to blind <hi>that</hi> Idolatry <hi>they were guilty of the better amongſt the</hi> Ignorant.

                  <p>He could not have given a clearer and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler teſtimony of the Truth of what we ſay, and the Falſhood of what he delivers, than is contained in thoſe two places. To what can we attribute this Change in <hi>E.

                  </head>
                  <p>MY firſt, and chief Proof, is taken from what is already ſaid out of Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, Fathers, Proteſtants and Pagans. For thoſe univerſal Propoſitions contain all, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very God of Paganiſm. <hi>V. C.</hi> What are the Propoſitions of Scripture? <hi>All the Gods of the Gentiles are Divels.</hi> And, <hi>The Pagans ſacrificed to Divels, not to God.</hi> What are the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>E. S. One God of the Pagans was the true God, and no Devil.</hi> Item, <hi>The ſacrifices of the Pagans were offered to the true God, and not to the Divel.</hi> If the Logic of <hi>E. S.</hi> can reconcile with Truth two Contradictions, it is a rare one. Till he teach us how they can ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we will ſtick to the common received Axiom of Sophiſts, that both cannot be true: So one of thoſe Propoſitions muſt be falſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that of Scripture, or that of <hi>E. S.</hi> now I deſire him to declare whether he takes to be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106095:39"/>true, and whether the <hi>lyar:</hi> God or himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Again, Gal. 4.8. the Galatians <hi>knowing not God, ſerved thoſe who by nature were not Gods.</hi> Which are the words of the Apoſtle, and <hi>E. S.</hi> ſays, <hi>The Galatians knew Jupiter, and ſerved him, who was the true God:</hi> Wherein he directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The like Arguments might be brought from the Authority cited out of Fathers, Proteſtants and Pagans, who aſſuring univerſally, that all the Pagan Deities were raiſed from men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all poſſibility of <hi>Jupiters</hi> being otherwiſe, he being one of them. Indeed no body ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the Catholic Roman Church, that it did not adore the true God, altho many preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Adoration of the Saints, to be like to that of the Pagan <hi>Idolaters</hi> adoring of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundary Gods: why then ſhould the <hi>Pagans</hi> be abſolutely ſaid not to adore <hi>the true God,</hi> if they did adore him, altho they joyned others in alike degree of worſhip with him? But ſeeing <hi>E. S.</hi> and <hi>G. B.</hi> pretend <hi>Jupiter</hi> to be the name of <hi>the true God bleſſed for evermore,</hi> amongſt the Pagans, I will ſhew, that <hi>Jupiter,</hi> according to Fathers, Poets and Proteſtants, was a man, as well as the reſt, and I will confirm all with <hi>E. S.</hi> his own Teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>My next Proof is taken from thoſe, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <hi>Jupiter</hi> with the reſt of the Gods, <hi>Saturn, Neptune, Pluto,</hi> &amp;c. as well as of the other Gods. We have heard <hi>Tertullian</hi> aſſure, that <hi>Saturn</hi> was the ancienteſt of their Gods, and that the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106095:39"/>reſt ought their being to him, and thence infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he being a man, all the reſt muſt have been ſo too. See alſo Lactan. Firm. who ſays, l. 1. c. 15. <hi>It is evident all the Gods were men.</hi> See <hi>Tertul.</hi> c. 10. p. 39. His words are cited above Sect. 3. note that <hi>Voſſius</hi> l. 1 Idol. c. 18. p. 139. thinks this an invincible Argument, to prove that by <hi>Saturn</hi> the Pagans underſtood <hi>Adam.</hi> Now if <hi>Saturn</hi> was the ancienteſt of all the Pagan Gods, <hi>Jupiter</hi> who is one of them, is not <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> eternal, and conſequently not <hi>the true God.</hi> See <hi>Minutius Felix</hi> p. 23. where <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> is ſaid to be caſt out of a poſſeſt body, as well as <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Serapis:</hi> as having nothing peculiar above the reſt. <hi>W. L.</hi> indeed put an Emphaſis upon his name, <hi>Jupiter himſelf,</hi> when he tranſlates thoſe words, which is not in the Author, at leaſt as we have him, which ſhews only, that the Pagans had a greater veneration for <hi>Jupiter</hi> then for the reſt; yet without taking him out of the number of thoſe <hi>Heathen Gods,</hi> who were ſubject to <hi>Chriſtian Exorciſms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Third Proof is from ſuch Fathers who relate his Country, Birth and Death. <hi>Minutius Felix</hi> pag. 17. <hi>The Birth, Countreys and Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres of the Gods are ſhewn.

Venit inops animi, lapidem pro filio ſorpſit; ſic Deus evaſit, dicitur modo Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter ille. Saturn was a king, who out of fear of his own children, devoured them; but one of them was ſaved, a ſtone in lieu of him being given to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he ſwallowed, ſo this infant grew up to be a God, and is called Jupiter.</hi>

                  <p>My fourth Proof is from thoſe Fathers, who abſolutely refuſe to acknowledge the Divinity of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> Origen. l. 1. contra Celſum p. 19. <hi>Aſſoon as we hear the name of Jupiter, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſon of Saturn and Ops, Juno's husband, Neptunes brother.</hi> And l. 5. p. 262. <hi>We will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther endure any torments, than acknowledge Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be God. Lactantius Firmianus,</hi> called com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly by the Fathers, <hi>The Chriſtian Cicero,</hi> whom <hi>Photius</hi> judges to be the moſt learned and eloquent of his Age, and who for his capacity was choſen by the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, to be Tutor to his Son <hi>Criſpus.</hi> He I ſay, l. 1. Inſtit. Divin. cap. 11. p. 38. ſays, <hi>Jovem illum eſſe, qui ex Ope Saturnoque natus ſit, negari non poteſt; vana igitur eſt perſuaſio eorum, qui nomen Jovis ſummo Deo tribuunt: ſolent enim quidam errores ſuos hac excuſatione defendere, qui convicti de uno Deo, cùm id negare non poſſunt, ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum ſe colere affirmant; verum hoc ſibi placere ut Jupiter nominetur. Quo quid abſurdius? Jupiter enim ſine contubernio conjugis filiaeque coli non ſolet, unde quid ſit apparet, nec fas eſt id nomen transferri, ubi nec Minerva eſt ulla, nec Juno. It cannot be denied that Jupiter was born of Ops and Saturn; wherefore it is a vain or fooliſh perſuaſion, of thoſe who would give the name of Jupiter to the ſupreme God.</hi> (Obſerve this Mr. <hi>E. S.</hi>) <hi>For ſome are wont in that manner to excuſe their errors, when they had been convinced of one God, ſo as they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it, by ſaying that themſelves adored him, and called him Jupiter. Than which what can be
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106095:41"/>more abſurd? Seing Jupiter is not worſhip'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the partnerſhip of his wife and daughter, whence it plainly appears, what this Jupiter is, and that the name ought not to be transferred thither, where there is no Minerva, nor Juno.</hi> Thus this learned Man, whoſe words are ſo clear, that if he were now alive, and intended to reject <hi>E. S.</hi> his new error, he could not do it more convincingly.</p>
                  <p>My Fifth Proof is taken from the Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf, as you may ſee in <hi>Tertul. S. Cyprian, Julius Firmicus,</hi> and <hi>Minutius Fclix</hi> above cited, add to theſe <hi>Prudentius in Apotheoſi.</hi>

                  <p>Out of which Verſes <hi>E. S.</hi> may learn, firſt the Form of our Exorciſms, which to this day are made after that manner, trampling the proud Spirit under our feet, with diſdainful language.</p>

                  <p>He may learn thirdly, that not only the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Gods; but even <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf was ſubject to the whips and torments inflicted by our Exorciſts.</p>
                  <p>My Sixth Proof is draw from the Opinion of the Pagans. See <hi>Natalis Comes</hi> l. 2. mythol. c. 1. and ſequent. Where you find many cited. <hi>Lucian in Jove Tragaedo,</hi> ſays that <hi>Damis</hi> an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt, having objected to one who defended the Divinity of the Gods, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> the chief of them was dead, as alſo his ſepulcher, which was extant, and a Pillar near it, teſtifying the truth of that death: <hi>Jupiter</hi> he ſays, grew pale, and diſmayed hearing it, being conſcious of the Truth, and that Truth tended to root up the Opinion of his <hi>Divinity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Seventh Proof is grounded on what the Fathers write of him, <hi>viz. 1ſt.</hi> That he was not a God. <hi>2ly.</hi> But that he was a Man. <hi>3ly.</hi> That he was a wicked man, ſubject to ſuch vices, as would make any civil man bluſh. <hi>Juſtinus M. Paraen,</hi> pag. 2. ſhews him to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayled like a woman the death of <hi>Sarpedon.</hi> His inſatiable luſt both after women and boys, is known to all; ſo is his Ambition, which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelf by his Rebellion againſt his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now how can the Fathers be excuſed from horrible Blaſphemy, in accuſing the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <hi>Jupiter</hi> of theſe crimes, if he be <hi>the true God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:106095:42"/>
                  <p>I conclude this Proof with an invincible Reaſon taken out of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> l. 1. <hi>de conſenſu Evangeliſtarum.</hi> c. 26. None of all the Gods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored by Pagans, oppoſed the Adoration of any other. <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Minerva</hi> never expreſs'd any diſlike of men adoring of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apus; Saturn</hi> was willing his rebellious Son <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſhould be adored; <hi>Vulcan</hi> very quietly endured the company of <hi>Venus,</hi> his wanton Wife, and of <hi>Mars,</hi> whom he had found <hi>in fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granti</hi> with her. And <hi>Jupiter</hi> never checked his daughter <hi>Venus,</hi> for thoſe filthy faults, which would have made her unfit company for civil Men, or Women. Whence the Saint concludes them all, and <hi>Jupiter</hi> too, to have been Devils, who aimed only at the corruption of manners. This he confirms, from the Law of <hi>the true and living God,</hi> who forbad them all to be adored, commanded all their Statues to be pulled down, all their Rites, and Ceremonies, and Sacrifices to be aboliſhed. By which, <hi>Satis oſtendit illos fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſos atque fallaces, &amp; ſe eſſe verum ac veracem Deum,</hi> he convinces ſufficiently that falſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion newly broach'd by <hi>E.</hi> S.</p>
                  <p>My laſt Proof is taken from the Teſtimony of learned Proteſtants, who all acknowledged this Truth, till the deſire of accuſing Popery en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged <hi>E. S.</hi> in the contrary Opinion. We have ſeen <hi>W. L.</hi> naming <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf. Godwin. l. 4. Antiquitat. c. 2. ſays that <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Baal ſemen,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>the Lord of Heaven,</hi> is one and the ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> The Sun, as the <hi>Queen</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:106095:42"/>or <hi>Lady of Heaven,</hi> is the Moon. <hi>Voſſius</hi> is of the ſame Opinion with us, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> was a Man. We have ſeen above that <hi>E. S.</hi> in his <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigines Sacrae,</hi> ſays in general, that all Heathen Gods had been Men, and approved of <hi>Philo Bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> his Judgment, who blamed the ſubtiller Greeks turning all to Mythologies.

                  <p>OUR Diſpute is not of the firſt beginners and planters of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> but of thoſe who lived at, and ſince the time of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> till <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> prevailed.</p>
                  <p>I do not doubt at all, but God, when he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Man, endowed him with all Knowledge ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the end, for which he created him: and certainly that of his Creator was as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary as any, ſeeing upon it was grounded his Obligation to ſerve God, by fulfilling his Will
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106095:47"/>and obeying his Commands.</p>
                  <p>It is, I think no leſs certain, that all and every Soul, at its Creation, receives an <hi>Idea</hi> of God and that ſo deeply imprinted in it, that no ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, no want of Education, no bad Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, can wear it out, or entirely deface it. Hence it is, that altho ſeveral barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions adore, as Gods, things which are not God, (as hath been ſeen of the <hi>Pagans,</hi>) yet there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were any without ſome Object of Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they thought to be <hi>God.</hi> Yet Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon left to it ſelf, and taking the freedom of Diſcourſe about it, will cover it with Errors, which may darken its lineaments without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying it; as Rubbiſh thrown upon an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Statue, will hide its Beauty from the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators eye, altho it never alters the ſituation of its parts, nor deſtroys their proportion. One great Advantage we have by <hi>Faith,</hi> is that it fixeth in our Souls a right Idea of God, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes thoſe Imaginations which are inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with it. The whole created World is left to the Diſputations of Men's hearts (<hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> 3.11.) for the Exerciſe of their Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, in which they are often miſtaken (for they <hi>ſhall not find out the work, that God maketh from the beginning to the end.</hi>) yet their Errors are without prejudice to the main chance, their Salvation; as long as they contain themſelves within their Bounds, nor endeavour to know more of God, then they ſhould, or have learnt of him, nor labour to meaſure <hi>Immenſity</hi> with a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106095:47"/>
                     <hi>Span.</hi> Otherwiſe by lamentable Experience they will find the Truth of thoſe words, <hi>Scrutator Majeſtatis opprimetur à gloria.</hi> Of which we have as many Examples, as Philoſophers, who attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted it. The wiſeſt of them all in this was, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides,</hi> who ſaid ingenuouſly to <hi>Hero,</hi> that the more he ſtudied it, the leſs he underſtood of it. Hence S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> l. 8. de Trinit. c. 2. having ſaid that <hi>God is Truth,</hi> gives us warning to ſtick in the thought of that Term: <hi>Noli quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere quid ſit veritas, ſtatim enim ſe opponent caligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes imaginum corporalium, &amp; nubila phantaſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, &amp; perturbabunt ſerenitatem, quae primo ictu illuxit tibi, cùm dicerem Veritas. Ecce in primo ictu quo velut coruſcatione perſtringeris, cum dicitur ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas, mane ſi potes, ſed non potes. Relaberis in iſta ſolita atque terrena. When I ſay, Truth, examin not what it is I mean, otherwiſe miſts of Phancies and clouds of corporeal Images will interpoſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave you of the light that appeared at firſt: ſtop, if poſſible in the firſt glimpſe of the light: but you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it, for you always ſlide into other thoughts.</hi> And the following Chapter he diſcourſes in a like manner of the Thought of <hi>Good. Bonum hoc, &amp; bonum illud. Tolle hoc &amp; illud, &amp; vide ipſum bonum, ſi potes, ita Deum videbis, non alio bono bonum; ſed bonum omnis boni. Speak not of this good, or that good: take away this, and that and ſee, if poſſible, goodneſs it ſelf and you will ſee God, not good by any other goodneſs diſtinct from him; but the goodneſs of all good things.</hi> Thus whither we conceive God, <hi>as the prime Truth,</hi>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:106095:48"/>or as <hi>the ſovereign good,</hi> our <hi>firſt Thoughts are</hi> Orthodox; as coming from God the Author of Nature, and our miſery proceeds from our not ſtopping in them.</p>
                  <p>This was the reaſon why <hi>Tertullian l. de Teſtim. animae c.</hi> 1. being deſirous to ſhew, for the Satisfaction of the Pagans, that natural I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of <hi>one God,</hi> which all Souls ever had, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins only ſuch a Soul, as retains its native ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, without any adſcitious knowledge. <hi>Non eam te advoco,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>quae ſcholis formata, bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liothecis exercitata, Academicis &amp; Porticibus par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam ſapientiam ructas. Te ſimplicem &amp; rudem, &amp; impolitam, &amp; idioticam compello, qualem habent, qui te ſolam habent illam ipſam de compito, &amp; tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio, de textrino totam.

Ea ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulo, quae tecum in hominem infers, quae aut ex temetipſa, aut ex quocumque Authore tuo didiciſti. I would not have thee O Soul, framed in Schools, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in Libraries, filled with the Learning of the Platonicks or Stoicks, I deſire thee rude, ſimple, impoliſh'd, and an idiot, ſuch as thou art in the pooreſt and meaneſt Artiſan. I have need of thy Ignorance, for thy learning is ſuſpected. I would know what ſentiments thou broughteſt with thee into thy body, whether thou hadſt them of thy ſelf, or receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt them of thy Creator.</hi> He ſays the ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in his Apologetick <hi>cap.</hi> 17. <hi>p.</hi> 43. and 48. only he extends this Teſtimony of the unlearned, to the learned Soul, in ſudden occurrences, when acquired Learning is uſeleſs, and nature alone
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106095:48"/>worketh. And he gives another reaſon, why our Underſtanding retains not as it ſhould do, the firſt Idea of God: the greatneſs of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſurpaſſing its capacity. <hi>Deum vis magnitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis &amp; notum hominibus objecit, &amp; ignotum.</hi> Which you may likewiſe find in S. <hi>Cyp. de Idol. van. p.</hi> 206.</p>
                  <p>Out of what I have ſaid, you may ſee, that our queſtion is not, whether we have all a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Opinion of <hi>one God?</hi> But whither the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the <hi>Pagans</hi> did teach, that there was but <hi>one God?</hi> or whether the Unity of God was a principle of their Religion, and an Article of their <hi>Faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Anſwer to this Queſtion; is <hi>negative:</hi> So that we ſay <hi>Polytheiſm</hi> was an eſſential Point of <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> and one main Queſtion debated betwixt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> was whither there was only one God? This I gather firſt out of Scripture. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. (or 76.) <hi>Notus in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea Deus, &amp; in Iſrael magnum nomen ejus. In Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah God is known, and his name is great in Iſrael.</hi> As if out of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> he had not been known. S. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſays that is to be underſtood <hi>before the Croſs of Chriſt had lightned the world. Antequam illuminaret Crux mundum, &amp; antequam videretur Dominus in terra: quando autem venit Salvator, in omnem terram exivit ſonus eorum.</hi> But <hi>when our B. Savior came, the name of God was ſpread to the extremities of the Earth,</hi> amongſt the Believers or Chriſtians.</p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:106095:49"/>
                  <p>And S. Auſtin. <hi>Solent inimici Domini Jeſu Chriſti omnibus noti Judaei gloriari in iſto Pſalmo, quem cantavimus, dicentes: Notus in Judea Deus, &amp; inſultare gentibus quibus non eſt notus Deus, &amp; dicere quia ſibi ſolis notus eſt Deus, alibi ergo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. Notus eſt autem revera in Judaea Deus, ſi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligant quid ſit Judea. Nam verè non eſt notus Deus, niſi in Judaea. Ecce &amp; hoc nos dicimus, The known Enemies of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, glory in this Pſalm and inſult over the Gentiles, ſaying, that God is known to them,</hi> the Jews, <hi>wherefore he muſt be unknown to the Nations. Now we grant that God is known only to</hi> Jews <hi>or in</hi> Jewry. And then he ſhews that the Chriſtians Circumciſion of the Heart and Spirit (of which <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.29.) doth entitle them to the Knowledge of God, reſtrained in that Pſalm to <hi>Juda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, out of Teſtimony of the Pagan Gods, taken out S. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexan.</hi> lib. 5. contra <hi>Julianum,</hi> pag. 108. where he ſays: <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Doctrin of the Hebrews is confirmed by the Teſtimony of Julian's Gods: Apollo being conſulted, what Nations were the wiſeſt? The Oracle anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:106095:49"/>The Chaldaeans, for Philoſophy, or natural Learning, but the Jews (who adore only one God and King) for Divinity.</hi> As the <hi>Poliglot</hi> paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Oracles ſenſe, <hi>Prolog.</hi> 12. <hi>pag.</hi> 82.

                  <p>Thirdly out of Fathers. We cannot deſire a better witneſs of the Sentiments of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and the Point diſputed betwixt them and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> than <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who very probably had been one himſelf, at leaſt had convers'd with their Perſons, and Writings: what I cite here out of him, is the more to be valued, becauſe S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> uſes the ſame Argument, lib. de Idol. vanit. pag. 207. Now <hi>Tertullian,</hi> lib. de teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monio animae c. 2. <hi>Non placemus, Dominum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicantes hoc nomine unico unicum, à quo omnia, &amp; ſub quo univerſa. Dic teſtimonium ſi ita ſcis. Nam te quoque palam, &amp; totâ libertate, quâ non licet nobis, domi ac foris audimus ita pronunciare, quod Deus dederit, &amp; ſi Deue voluerit: eâ voce, &amp; aliquem eſſe ſignificas, &amp; omnem illi confiteris poteſtatem, ad cujus ſpectas voluntatem, ſimul &amp; caeteros negas Deos eſſe, dum ſuis vocabulis nuncu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas Saturnum Jovem. Nam ſolum Deum confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, quem tantùm Deum nominas, ut &amp; cùm illos interdum Deos appellas, &amp; alieno &amp; quaſi pro mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuo uſa videaris. The Pagans are diſpleaſed with us, when we preach one Lord, from whom are all things, to whom are all ſubject. Speak O Soul, what
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:106095:50"/>thou knoweſt of this, ſpeak boldy with that freedom which is granted to thee, tho denied to us.</hi> Thou ſayeſt, <hi>God grant it, if it pleaſe God: by which words thou expreſſeſt ſome one, and acknowledgeſt, that he hath all power, and denies thoſe to be Gods, whom thou deſigneſt by their Names, Saturn, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, Mars, &amp;c. For thou profeſſeſt to believe one whom thou calleſt God of thy ſelf; and when thou giveſt that name to others, thou uſeſt borrowed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again Apolog. 17. pag. 47. <hi>Quod colimus, Deus unus eſt.</hi> This is the Chriſtian Poſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Pagans, We adore only one God.</hi> And p. 48. <hi>Vultis ex operibus ipſius, vultis ex animae ipſius te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonio, comprobemus: quae licet carcere corporis preſſa, licet inſtitutionibus pravis circumſcripta, licet libidinibus &amp; concupiſcentiis evigorata, licet Diis falſis exancillata, cum tamen reſipiſcit, ut ex crapula, ut ex ſomno, ut ex aliqua valetudine, &amp; ſanitatem ſuam patitur, Deum nominat hoc ſolo, quia propriè verus hic unus, Deus bonus &amp; magnus. Et quod Deus dederit, Judicem quoque illum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtatur, Deus videt, Deo commendo, &amp; Deus mihi reddet. Shall I prove this one God out of his works, or out of the teſtimony of man's Soul? which altho it be ſhut up in the priſon of the Body, ſpoiled by bad Inſtructions, weakned by concupiſcence, and enſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to falſe Gods, yet if ſhe come to her ſelf, ſhe profeſſes one God, great and good, ſhe calls him to witneſs, ſaying, God knows, I leave it to God.</hi> Then <hi>Tertullian</hi> concludes with this Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>O teſtimonium animae naturaliter Chriſtianae.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106095:50"/>O teſtimony of a Soul, which is Chriſtian by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture!</hi> Now I deſire to know of <hi>E. S.</hi> how he could inferr the Soul naturally to be Chriſtian, becauſe naturally it owned <hi>one only God,</hi> if this were not the main point controverted? will he ſay, I am a Proteſtant becauſe I profeſs to believe <hi>one God,</hi> as Proteſtants do? or ſhall I ever think <hi>E. S.</hi> a Papiſt, for ſaying he <hi>believes in Chriſt.</hi> No certainly, thoſe being Points in which both parties agree. <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s great wit would never be ſo eaſily ſurpriz'd with hopes of a Proſelyte, if what <hi>E. S.</hi> ſays be true, that both contending Parties agreed in profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>one God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame Reaſon might be brought out of <hi>Minutius Felix,</hi> who ſays pag. 14. <hi>Audio vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus cùm ad coelum manus tendunt, nihil aliud quam Deum dicunt; &amp; Deus magnus eſt. Vulgi iſte na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalis ſermo eſt, an Chriſtiani confitentis oratio? I hear the People call upon God.</hi> (naming only one) <hi>Are theſe words the ſpeech of Pagan, or the Confeſſion of Faith of a Chriſtian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here methinks, I ſee <hi>E. S.</hi> triumphing, as finding what deſtroys my Concluſion, in the foregoing words: which ſhew that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple believed <hi>one God.</hi> But I anſwer, that all <hi>expreſt that belief in their indeliberat Actions, and deliberately acted contrary:</hi> and for that reaſon were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> condemned by their own judgment. Let us hear <hi>Tertullian</hi> l. de teſtim. animae c. 6. p. 126. <hi>Meritò igitur omnis anima rea &amp; teſtis eſt, in tantùm rea erroris, in quantùm
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106095:51"/>teſtis veritatis, &amp; ſtabit ante aulas Dei in die judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cii, nihil habens dicere. Deum praedicabas, &amp; non requirebas, damonia abominabaris, &amp; illa adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas. Judicium Dei appellabas, nec eſſe credebas: Inferna ſupplicia praeſumebas, &amp; non praecavebas: Chriſtianum nomen ſapiebas, &amp; Chriſtianum perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebaris. Wherefore every Soul is deſervedly guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and witneſs againſt herſelf the more guilty of her error, becauſe ſhe is witneſs of the Truth: ſhe will in the day of Judgment, ſtand before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of God, and have not one word to ſay for her ſelf, when it ſhall be reproach'd to her: Thou didſt ſpeak of God, and didſt not ſeek him: Thou hatedſt the Devil, and didſt adore him: Thou didſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Gods judgment, without believing it: Thou didſt ſpeak of the pains of Hell, without endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to avoid it: Thou hadſt in thy hear that great Chriſtian Truth,</hi> That there is but one God; <hi>yet thou didſt perſecute Chriſtians,</hi> for profeſſing it.</p>

Thou art the firſt of all the Roman Emperors who adored the only true God.</hi>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:106095:51"/>How could <hi>Conſtantin</hi> have been the firſt, if all other Emperors, had adored the <hi>only true God,</hi> before him?</p>
                  <p>Yet I deſire <hi>E. S.</hi> to anſwer one or two Queſtions: If all the Underſtanding Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Pagans</hi> believed <hi>One God,</hi> how came <hi>Socrates</hi> to be condemned for that Opinion by the <hi>Areopagites?</hi> Why did <hi>Plato</hi> fear the ſame Fate, and for that Reaſon deliver his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo obſcurely, about that <hi>One God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There occurrs to me one only tolerable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, againſt what I here aſſert: <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Fauſtus</hi> the <hi>Manichaean</hi> reproaches to Chriſtians, That they received the <hi>Opinion of Monarchy</hi> (that is the Belief of one God) from the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans:</hi> whence it follows, that the <hi>Pagans</hi> believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but one God. To which I anſwer 1. It is certain we received that Dogme, not from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans;</hi> but from God: So <hi>Fauſtus</hi> is moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtaken in that. And why may not we ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his Teſtimony, as to the other part of the Opinion of <hi>Pagans,</hi> concerning one God? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer 2. with S. <hi>Auſtin. l.</hi> 20. <hi>contra Fauſt. c.</hi> 19. That the <hi>Pagans</hi> were not to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree blinded with their falſe Gods, and true Devils Arts, as to have entirely loſt the Image of <hi>one true God,</hi> received at their Creation: tho for their Ingratitude to their <hi>Creator,</hi> they were permitted to fall to the Adoration of the <hi>Creatures, Idols</hi> and <hi>Devils.</hi> Thus S. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly their Wiſe Men through the miſt of pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Ceremonies could ſee the Fondneſs of Men,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:106095:52"/>that invented them, and the wickedneſs of Devils, who promoted them.</p>
                  <p>Nay I willingly grant, that all learned <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> blamed the Poetical Fables of their Gods. I acknowledge with <hi>Tertullian Apolog. c.</hi> 46. <hi>pag.</hi> 75. That the Philoſophers impugned them, and were for this applauded, and honored by the reſt. Yet after all this, what thoſe ſame Philoſophers taught concerning <hi>the God,</hi> is pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and worſe; as you may ſee in <hi>Tertul. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinus M.</hi> and <hi>Athenagoras.</hi> The <hi>Epicureans</hi> fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied him fondly, as if they deſigned to make him ridiculous. <hi>Deos jocandi cauſâ induxit Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus pellucidos atque perflatiles.

Yet in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that Similitude, which they promis'd, was no great perfection or advantage, ſeeing they thought the whole World to be God. <hi>Quid eſt Deus?</hi> ſaid <hi>Seneca</hi> l. 1. natur. qq. <hi>quod vides totum, &amp; quod non vides.

                  <p>THe greateſt difficulty (againſt what I have ſaid, <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. about the <hi>Pagan Jupiter,</hi> not being the true God, but firſt a Man, and then a Divel (is taken from Act. 17.23. <hi>I found an Altar,</hi> ſays the B. Apoſtle, <hi>with this Inſcription, TO THE <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NKNOWN GOD, whom therefore ye ignorantly worſhip, him I declare unto you.</hi> This <hi>E. S.</hi> pretends to be meant of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and confirms it very artificially out of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus,</hi> out of whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> cites ſome pieces of Verſes. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaying he preach'd him, it will follow that he preach'd <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and ſo <hi>Jupiter</hi> muſt be a name of the <hi>true God:</hi> for certainly S. <hi>Paul</hi> never preach'd any other. Thus <hi>E. S.</hi> p. 7.</p>
                  <p>How his learned Adverſary <hi>T. G.</hi> hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged this debated Point, I cannot tell; but doubtleſs his works, if I had them, would give me great light. And what I ſay, I ſhall willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reform according to his, in caſe it may be materially different.</p>
                  <p>I think it certain, that <hi>the unknown God,</hi> was not <hi>Jupiter.</hi> To prove this, I may bring all thoſe Authors, <hi>Pagans</hi> and Chriſtians, who ſpeak of the occaſion of dedicating this Altar. Again
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106095:53"/>
                     <hi>Jupiter</hi> could not be ſaid, to be <hi>an unknown God in Athens;</hi> for they knew his Country, his Birth, his Life and Death, his Sepulcher, his Geſts, his Parents, &amp;c. Their Theaters, their Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, their Temples, did ring with his Name. Thirdly they had Altars erected to his honor, in their <hi>Forum,</hi> their Corners-of-Streets, and even in their private houſes; whereas there was only one Altar erected to this <hi>unknown God.</hi> Fourthly had S. <hi>Paul</hi> declared <hi>Jupiter</hi> to them, he would at leaſt <hi>en paſſant,</hi> have reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted thoſe abſurd Fables, which were told of him: Of his Birth and Death, of his Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and filthy Luſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which are much more unbeſeeming a God, as being more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to mortality than the things the Apoſtle ſpeaks of.) At which the Apoſtle doth not hint in the leaſt manner.</p>
                  <p>Hence it followeth, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> did not preach <hi>Jupiter;</hi> this is evident of what I have ſaid, and the Apoſtles words, <hi>Quem ignorantes colitis hunc ego annuncio. Whom you ignorantly worſhip, him I declare.</hi> So that he ſpeaks clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>unknown God,</hi> who was not <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What ſhall we then ſay to <hi>Aratus,</hi> who clearly ſpeaks of <hi>Jupiter? Anſwer.</hi> What he ſaid of God was true, and conformable to that <hi>natural Idea,</hi> which as is aboveſaid, we all have of <hi>God;</hi> but he erroniouſly applied to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the <hi>Arch divel.</hi> Now S. <hi>Paul</hi> takes his thoughts which were true, and applies them to that <hi>ſelf exiſtent Being,</hi> to whom alone they belong:
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106095:54"/>as if a Crown by Rebells ſet upon a Subjects Head, ſhould be taken off it, and ſet on the Kings, to whom of right it belongs.</p>
                  <p>Where, by the by, we may take notice of a groſs Error of <hi>Seneca,</hi> who ſays, it is as good to have no thought at all, as an erroneous one of God: <hi>Quid intereſt Deum neges, an infames?</hi> God out of his goodneſs to Man hath given him that Idea of himſelf, which being preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved altho defaced with Errors, yet will help to correct them when we make a right uſe of our Reaſon. As the ſtatue (of which I ſpoke in the Fifth Sect.) laid in the dirt, may be taken up, bruſh'd and waſh'd, ſo as to be reſtored to its firſt Beauty. Thus S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> convinced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that the <hi>Manichaean</hi> Hereſie could not be true. Thus the Philoſophers ſaw the Falſhood of their <hi>Pagan Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I pray God many others, who at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hold Errors in Religion, may ſo uſe their Reaſon as to overcome them.</p>

                     <hi>To conclude this whole Treatiſe, we will uſe two or three Paſſages of</hi> Tertullian, <hi>to confirm, what we have hitherto ſaid.

As for your Idols, they are compoſed of the ſame matter, of which are our moſt ordinary veſſels, nay ſometimes our veſſels are turned into them being changed by the ſacrilegious working of a Statuary. And it might be a comfort in our torments to us, that we undergo only the ſame operations, which they are ſubjected too, to become Gods. Are we raiſed on a Croſs? your Gods are ſet on them, to be ſhaped. Do you rake our ſides with iron hookes? your Gods are more roughly carved by an ax, a chizel, a plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Do you caſt us into the fire? In that your Gods are melted to be caſt into their mould. Are we ſentenced to the mines? Thence your Gods are drawn. Are we baniſh'd to the Iſlands? In thoſe many of your Gods are born, or dead. They are as inſenſible of the rough Workman, as of your ceremonious rites. Do we not therefore rather deſerve Commendation, than puniſhment, for diſcovering and rejecting ſo groſs an error, as it is, to take for God, what is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a liveleſs creature, as every ſpider, and other inſect doth perceive?</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of Mediating Spirits.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. B. p.</hi> 24. <q>COncerning theſe <hi>(the Souls of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed men)</hi> the Heathens believed that they were certain intermedial Powers, that went betwixt God and Men, by whom alſo all our Services were offered to the gods.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> We have here many errors in few words. The firſt is, That the Souls of deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men were univerſally by all Pagans thought to act any thing in this World. In <hi>Virgil, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> and others, you may ſee, that many (thoſe of wicked Men) only ſuffered, being conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be puniſhed for their Faults. Nay out of the ſame Authors it is probable, that even the better, more innocent, and therefore eſteemed happy Souls, took their Pleaſure in the <hi>Eliſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an fields,</hi> without troubling themſelves with things of this world. This is much confirmed from the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Doctrin of the Tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of Souls from one Body to another, which was very common amongſt the Pagan learned Philoſophers. None of theſe could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>the Souls of deceaſed Men could be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diating Spirits,</hi> which you aſcribe to all Pagans.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that <hi>deceaſed Men,</hi> even when deified, were by all held to be <hi>mediating Powers.</hi> I have ſhewed at large above, that the <hi>prime gods</hi> had been <hi>men:</hi> and that the <hi>Jupiter</hi> had
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:106095:58"/>been one, I deſire you to conſider the grounds I have laid for this Aſſertion: for which ſee alſo <hi>Julius Firmicus</hi> pag. 4. <hi>Romulus</hi> was a Man, the Founder and firſt King of <hi>Rome,</hi> (I hope you do not expect I ſhould prove this) yet he had a <hi>Flamen</hi> conſecrated to his Service; which was <hi>an officer peculiar to the ſupreme God,</hi> ſays <hi>E. S. p.</hi> 34. and conſequently was thought to be <hi>him,</hi> or was ranked with <hi>him.</hi> Indeed <hi>Divinity</hi> in the Opinion of the credulous deluded Antiquity was very eaſily purchaſed: to <hi>diſappear unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly</hi> was enough. Thus <hi>Romulus</hi> whoſe Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory is known to all. Thus <hi>Amilcar,</hi> a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> ſeeing his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my defeated, whilſt he was ſacrificing threw himſelf into the fire, where he was conſumed: thus he appeared not, and for that reaſon was held to be a <hi>god</hi> by his Country-men. <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> of <hi>Aſtipala</hi> a Wraſtler, having knocked down his Antagoniſt with his fiſt, tore open his ſide, and pulled out his heart; but in lieu of the Reward he expected, finding his Cruelty had diſpleaſed the Judges, with indignation he departed, and finding a School-maſter with his Diſciples under a vault, he pulled away the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar which upheld it, and buried them all with its ruins. Thence he fled into a cave, or den, to avoid thoſe who purſued him, to bring him to condign Puniſhment. But that being digged open, and he not found in it, by command of the Oracle, he was adored as a <hi>god.</hi> As you may ſee in <hi>Theodoret lib.</hi> 8. <hi>de Cur. Graec. affect.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:106095:58"/>p.</hi> 597. and <hi>lib.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 631. and in <hi>Plut.</hi> and <hi>Suidas.</hi> Out of this Perſwaſion it was that <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedocles</hi> threw himſelf into mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> that nothing of him being found, they might think him tranſlated to Heaven: and he probably might have obtained it, had not his braſs ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, or ſoles, caſt out by the force of the fire diſcovered that he had miſtaken his way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>By ſlight a man otherwiſe obſcure got to be adored in <hi>Libia,</hi> as God: for having taught ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Birds to ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Great God Pſaphon.</hi> (which was his name) and letting them go, they in the Woods repeated this Leſſon, and the People hearing them, adored him with Altars, Sacrifices and Temples. He owed his <hi>Apotheoſis</hi> to the Birds. <hi>Anno</hi> a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> attempted the ſame; but loſt his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, the Birds forgetting their Leſſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming their wild notes, aſſoon as they recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Liberty.</p>
               <p>A third Error is, That all the Pagans believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any Mediators betwixt their gods and them. In thoſe remnants of their Rituals, which are extant, there is not one word of <hi>Mediation</hi> or <hi>Interceſſion,</hi> demanded of the inferior Deities, called <hi>Dii minorum Gentium.</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaking of that doctrin, <hi>l.</hi> 8. and 9. <hi>de Civ. Dei,</hi> ſeems to attribute it to <hi>Plato</hi>'s School, as not being an Article of Faith of the <hi>heathens</hi> Creed; but a private Opinion of one School of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. He ſeems, I ſay, to inſinuate this: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106095:59"/>you, Sir, to ſhew out of <hi>Plato,</hi> or <hi>Apuleius,</hi> or any of thoſe writers, theſe words, or any others equivalent; <hi>Hercules pray to thy father Jupiter for me,</hi> or <hi>us. Romulus intercede for us.</hi> So that the greateſt part of the <hi>Heathens</hi> did not dream of this <hi>Mediation,</hi> and thoſe who did aſſert it, treated nevertheleſs with thoſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators, as with true gods. Wherefore, ſhould I grant that all Pagans held the Souls of Men to mediate, yet there would be a vaſt difference betwixt their Sentiments, and thoſe of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholic Church, concerning our Saints. More Errors will appear out of the following Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>I think it impoſſible to give one <hi>Idea</hi> of what the Pagans taught of Spirits or incorporeal Subſtances, as this Name doth comprehend the Supreme of all, and the ſubordinate, or coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate immaterial Beings, and Souls ſeparated from their Bodies. <hi>Thales</hi>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106095:60"/>(which is the Tenet of the Catholic Church concerning Saints) which is alſo evidently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, we may rank this <hi>Paralel</hi> with <hi>Squaring Circles,</hi> and the <hi>Philoſophers ſtone,</hi> and expect to ſee the World made happy with theſe three Rarities together.</p>
               <p>As to the Mediation of Angels: <hi>Athenagoras</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Legat. pro Chriſt. pag. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> ſays indeed that the Chriſtian Opinion was that God created ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Orders of Angels: and had committed to their care the Government of the Elements, Heavens, and the whole World; not that any one Angel is governour of the World, (which the Scripture ſeems to deny, <hi>Job.</hi> 34, 14. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14.) but that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Angels have the Adminiſtration of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of it. I know no Decree of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church obliging us to believe this; and therefore I ſhould not dare to cenſure any Man who ſhould ſay the contrary. Yet that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath ſo much ground in Scripture, that I do not apprehend all Mr. <hi>G. B.</hi> can ſay, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it. <hi>Joſue</hi> 5.15. an Angel is ſaid to be <hi>the Captain of the Lords hoſt.</hi> He ſeems the ſame, who <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.1. is called <hi>Michael.</hi> And <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.20. there are others mentioned, viz. the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Greece.</hi> And why may not theſe be the Angels, who preſided over thoſe Countries? we are ſure that all Angels are <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them, who ſhall be heirs of Salvation.</hi> Heb. 1.14. and <hi>The little ones</hi> have <hi>Angels, who in Heaven always ſee
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:106095:60"/>the face of God.</hi> Matt. 18.10. And that ſeveral Angels aſcended and deſcended on <hi>Jacobs</hi> lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.12. was to ſhew they mediated betwixt God, who was at the top, and man, who lay at the bottom of the Ladder. Now, if particular <hi>Angels,</hi> have a care or charge of particular perſons: why may not ſome others have a larger diſtrict, and a more extended Charge?</p>
               <p>This you will ſay, is taken from <hi>Paganiſm.</hi> And I will anſwer, the <hi>Pagans</hi> took it from the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> not theſe from them. And it ſeems very probable, that when the <hi>Arch-divel,</hi> who took the Name of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> had ſo far prevailed with Men as to be by them advanced to the Throne of <hi>God:</hi> his next Attempt was, to get his wicked Spirits acknowledged for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of the World under him, in lieu of thoſe Bleſſed Spirits, who were the lawful Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours appointed by God himſelf. That Order of God was not to be abrogated with the Old Law, of which it was no part; it being an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment for the more connatural Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World, from the beginning to the end of it.</p>
               <p>I know God can govern all things by himſelf, immediately, without the Aſſiſtance of Men or Angels: that neither the greatneſs of Buſineſs can mate him, nor its number confound him, nor its variety diſtract him, nor its intricacy deceive him, nor its obſcurity hide it from his all ſeeing Eye. That having created the whole
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:106095:61"/>World <hi>with a word,</hi> he can govern it ſo too: yet he uſes Men,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom. 13.1.</note>: and he can call all to believe in him as he did <hi>Saul</hi>
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">Act. 9.</note> yet he employed an Angel to convert the Centurion<note n="(c)" place="margin">Act. 10.</note> and vouchſafes to be <hi>Fellow Labourer,</hi>

                  </gap> with Men, whom he honors with that Employment: and he can ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie thoſe whom he calls, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe <hi>of any creature;</hi> yet he will have us uſe water. And as to the work of the firſt day, the Creation of all things viſible and inviſible. God required the Aſiſtance of no Creature, ſo the whole work of the laſt day might be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by him alone; yet he will uſe the voice of an <hi>Archangel,</hi> to proclaim it<note n="(e)" place="margin">1 Theſſal. 4.16.</note> the Angels ſhall gather together thoſe who are raiſed again to life,<note n="(f)" place="margin">Mat. 24.31.</note>

                  <note n="(g)" place="margin">Matt. 13.49.50.</note>. Thus the Law and Prophets, Chriſt and his Apoſtles, the Old and New Teſtament, atteſt this Truth, that Angels concur to carrying on the work of our Salvation, and have a Commiſſion from God to direct us. Now for believing this Truth, <hi>Papiſts</hi> are accuſed of Superſtition and agreeing with <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and why we, more than <hi>Jacob,</hi> or <hi>Daniel, Joſue,</hi> or <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who taught the ſame? Blame them, if you dare; or abſolve us, for their ſakes, whom we follow.</p>

Iſta non eſſe Sacrificia Martyrum, novit, qui novit u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, quod Deo offertur, Sacrificum Chriſtianorum. Nos itaque Martyres noſtros divinis honoribus non colimus, nec Sacrificia illis offerimus. Who ever heard a Prieſt at the Altar ſay, I offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to thee, O Peter, Paul, or Cyprian, when upon their Sepulchers it is offered to God? Thoſe are not Sacrifices of Martyrs, as all know who know that one Sacrifice of Chriſtians which is there offered to God. Wherefore we do not worſhip Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs with divine Adorations, nor offer Sacrifice unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of which words you may learn 1. that Martyrs were worſhip'd in the primitive
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:106095:62"/>Church. 2. Their Tombs were turned into Altars. 3. That the Sacrifice of Chriſtians was offered upon thoſe tombs. And 4. That that Sacrifice was offered only to the living God; and not to the Martyrs. All which things to this day the <hi>Roman Catholic Church</hi> doth very religiouſly obſerve. By which appears the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the ancient and modern Church in <hi>doctrin</hi> and <hi>practice.</hi> As alſo the deformity betwixt the ancient Church, and the Proteſtant Reformation, in which there are neither Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs worſhip'd, nor their tombs regarded, nor Altars, nor Sacrifice.

So none but God hath Juriſdiction over thoſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:106095:63"/>bleſſed Souls, and by him alone that appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could be made. Now by what <hi>Revelation</hi> have you learnt that Act of God? what Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Author authentically recorded it?</p>

The very Prayers, which we make in our Lyturgies import that diſtinction: for they are addreſſed to God, beſeeching him to hear the Prayers, which doubtleſs the Saints make for us: or elſe when we pray to Saints, we deſire them to joyn with ours their Prayers to God: and when we have obtained our Requeſt we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them to joyn with us, in Thankſgiving to the Divine Goodneſs.<note n="(c)" place="margin">2.

               <p>But were Truth ſought for, an end would eaſily be made of this contentious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute betwixt Faith and Calumny, by only ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:106095:65"/>aright the Controverſie: we do all una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly profeſs, that God alone doth deſerve all the Adoration, and worſhip any Creature is capable of, for his own intrinſick and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial perfection. Yet we think it is his Pleaſure, that we ſhould honor not only thoſe Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in himſelf; but that we ſhould (for his ſake) reverence thoſe Creatures whom he makes partakers of his infinit fulneſs of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, according to the manner of their eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to partake of thoſe Perfections. So that God is honored in them all, and all they in him. We honor Kings and Prelates lawfully eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as being partakers of his Authority to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern us; the word of God, as being an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of his Will: The Sacraments as Channels to convey his Grace into our Souls: Churches, as places deſigned for Prayer to him: Saints on Earth, as living Temples of the Holy Ghoſt: Saints in Heaven, as Partakers of his glory. So that we may be ſaid to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor God in all; and by conſequence the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip given to them cannot be ſaid to draw from God.</p>
               <p>We likewiſe profeſs, that as God is the ſole Crearor of all things, ſo is he the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all Good, and that <hi>every good perfect Gift comes from him, the Father of Lights. Jac.</hi> 1.13. That nothing in order to eternal Life can be obtained, but of him, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. That his Providence reaches to every thing, that not a hair can either fall of its ſelf,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:106095:66"/>or be pulled out of our head by Men, or by bad or good Angels, without the permiſſion of God: that all we ſuffer, and all we enjoy, all good, and all bad, flow from his omnipotent hand, as effects either of his mercy, or of his juſtice, or of both. So that we fear nothing, but from him, nor hope for any thing, but from him. To him all our Prayers are directed, even thoſe made to Saints, which ſtop not in them, but in their, and our God and Father. This we believe, this we practiſe, this we teach, this we defend; ſpeak what you can againſt this, and you will ſpeak to the purpoſe, but if you paſs this unregarded, you beat the air.</p>
               <p>Another thing I deſire of you, is, not to build upon every little fancy, altho contrary to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: which is childiſh always, but deſerves a more ſevere cenſure in matters of conſequence. Now what can be more phantaſtical, than what Mr. <hi>Brevint</hi> writes, in his <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> that it is Idolatry to pray to Saints, unleſs they be within compaſs to hear us? And who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin how far they can hear? Or what Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> ſays in his <hi>Diſcourſe concerning Idolatry. pag.</hi> 154. <hi>Prayer offered to an inviſible being, and not corporeally preſent is due only to God.</hi> So that a blind Man may not deſire his Neighbor to pray for him becauſe all are inviſible to him. And Prayers offered to the Dragon, <hi>Dan.</hi> 14.23. or any Idols, would be no Idolatry, ſeeing they could ſee, or be ſeen, and were corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſent. And certainly S. <hi>Paul</hi> was an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:106095:66"/>when at a diſtance he deſired the <hi>Roman</hi> to pray for his good Journey, who were <hi>neither viſible to him, nor corporeally preſent.</hi> He follows the cuſtom of our Reformers, he throws ſtones without ever regarding where they fall. But what Proof doth he bring for his Novelty? The Authority of <hi>Dio</hi> and <hi>Martial,</hi> both <hi>Pagans,</hi> and one of them the moſt filthy, or beaſtly Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all Poets. And can Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> judge their Authority competent, to decide a Controverſy betwixt Chriſtians, and condemn the public pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Catholic Church?

D.</hi> 57, 58. and 132. in which places he ſhews the uſe of them to be ſo ancient, that if you pretend thoſe Bleſſings to be Popery, you muſt own the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Antiquity to be Papiſt.</p>
               <p>And as for Water bleſt by holy men, it is ſo far from being a diabolical <hi>Charm</hi> that it is an efficacious Remedy againſt Charms of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. You will find the vertue of it confirmed
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:106095:68"/>by miracles in Epiph. haer. 30. When it was uſed by <hi>Joſephus</hi> a Count under <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great.

That you cannot, for then you muſt own that one Divel caſt out another; and his kingdom is divided, which is by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour preſs'd againſt the Phariſees, as abſurd and incredible, and conſequently cannot be ſaid by a Chriſtian. Nay altho you deny all credit to theſe holy and learned Men, (which in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact is in a manner impudent) yet will you not be quit of this Argument, for at leaſt theſe Fathers thought Water ſo bleſt, a fit inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to work thoſe ſtupendious works, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would never have believed thoſe ſtories, neither would they have related them, without believing them.

               <p>
                  <hi>G. B. p.</hi> 34. <q>THE Sacramental Actions are pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by the ſuperfetation of ſo many new Rites whereby they are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed from their original Simplicity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> You can alledge nothing againſt our Rites or Ceremonies, but will ſerve as well againſt your own, and what you can ſay in defence of yours againſt <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfie your Argument againſt ours.</p>
               <p>It is a great folly, to look on Ceremonies as an eſſential part of our Worſhip: and it is as great to deny, that (when they are decent and ſignificant) they are great helps to it. Men are compoſed of Body and Soul: with both we muſt ſerve God, and each is an help to the other, when they concur to worſhip him. The Body can do nothing without the Soul, and all its Worſhip is meer hypocriſie, and not worthy of acceptation and dead, unleſs it be quickened by interiour <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> which flow from the Soul. And this Devotion ſoon grows cold, if it be not entertain'd with exterior Objects, and revived by ſenſible Actions; which fix the Imaginative faculty on the Acts of Religion in hand, and move the Will both of him, who Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiates, and of the Aſſiſtants, to diſpoſitions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the Rite, by a certain Sympathy
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106095:69"/>betwixt our Soul and Body: the Soul, feeling an inward veneration for God, to expreſs it, inclines the Body to Kneeling, Proſtrations, or the like, and theſe increaſe the interiour Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, when duly and devoutly made. This is the ſence of mankind; for there never was any People, who met to honour either God, or Prince, but had ſome ſettled Ceremonies with which they expreſs'd exteriourly their Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French Hugonots</hi> pared off thoſe they found in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church as ſuperſtitious: and the moſt Learned and Religious of that Communion, wiſh their worſhip were adorned with ſome Rites, whoſe want they lament, as being an undecent nakedneſs, and an occaſion of much Irreligion, and diſreſpectfulneſs in giving and receiving the Sacraments themſelves. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve did you purſue the Prophaneneſs ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in <hi>England,</hi> to its head, you will find your want and neglect of Religious Ceremonies to be the fountain of it.</p>
               <p>In your <hi>Vindication of the Laws,</hi> pag. 170. you ſay the Church hath power <hi>to determin of things, that may be done in a variety of ways into one particular Form, ſuch as preſcribing a ſet Form of Worſhip, the ordering the poſture in Sacraments, the Habits in Worſhip,</hi> &amp;c. Which will hedg in, what you reject, as well as what you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. B. pag.</hi> 34. <q>In Baptiſm inſtead of waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Water in the Name of the Father,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:106095:70"/>Son and Holy Ghoſt, they have added many adulterated Rites.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Theſe words ſignifie an <hi>Abrogation of Waſhing with Water, and a ſubſtitution of other Rites in lien of it,</hi> which is ſo far from Truth, and ſo black a Calumny, that I wonder you could advance it, or your Church permit it: eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſeeing the guilt falls on her, for not baptizing thoſe who fall from us to you, as ſhe ought to do, if we omit <hi>waſhing in the Name,</hi> which is the eſſential part of the Sacrament. But you ſpeak againſt Popery, and that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to juſtifie all untruths, and get a licence for any Calumny, as appears by this very Paſſage.</p>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:106095:70"/>This thou</hi> Julian, <hi>durſt not gainſay, fearing thy ſelf to be blown out of the Chriſtian World, if thou hadſt done ſo.</hi> So eſteemed was this Ceremony then, that even Hereticks durſt not ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it: which now is reproach'd to us as <hi>à Charm, a Superſtition,</hi> by our Reformers. Not a petty Miniſter, but thinks it a fit Object to be laught at, and to ſhew his wit, by playing the Buffoon upon it. By natural Generation all are <hi>born in ſin, children of wrath, ſlaves of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and in the power of Darkneſs:</hi> By ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Regeneration, which is Baptiſm, we are purged from Sin, freed from the bondage of the Devil, adopted the Children of God, <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the power of darkneſs, and tranſlated into the kingdom of the beloved Son of God.</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſ. 1.13. This Faith delivered by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, was believed by the primitive Chriſtians, and we believe the ſame: They uſed this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony to ſignifie this change in the Perſon baptized; we uſe it for the ſame intent: It was then ſo venerable, that even Heretics durſt not expreſs any diſeſteem of it; now you deride it, and look upon it as prophane and <hi>a Charm.</hi> Whence comes this change? from the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony? no, it is the ſame, it was then: from the Intention of thoſe who uſe it? no, it is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to ſignifie the change from Sin to Grace now, as it was then. The Change is only in your ſelf, and your Brethren Reformers: your Faith is as different from that of the Primitive, as of the preſent Church: and that new Faith
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:106095:71"/>enclines you to deride thoſe things, which the Church animated by Apoſtolical Faith, did, and doth eſteem.</p>
               <p>By this you ſee how <hi>Impious</hi> this <hi>Lucian</hi> like ſpirit is. How imprudent it is, will appear, if you conſider how full your Aſſemblies are of Libertines, who deride all things of Devotion, even practiſed by your ſelves, as ſeveral tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally complain of in their Sermons. You foſter in them this Spirit, by your Practiſe: you plant that Tree in their Hearts, which produces ſuch ſour Fruit, that ſets all your teeth an edge: this Serpent is bread in the bowels of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and ſerpent like it will eat the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of her Parent, and kill her, if it be not ſtifled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. B. pag.</hi> 35. <q>The Prieſt at Maſs, often hows, ſometimes he turns to the People, and gives them a ſhort barbarian Benediction, then goes on.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> In all this I ſee nothing ridiculous, but your relating thoſe ſacred Rites. How can he expreſs his inward Worſhip of God more clearly, than by kneeling or bowing? His Office is to be a Mediator betwixt God and Man (<hi>Heb.</hi> 5.1.) and how can that be better repreſented, than by his humble applications to God, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, and liſting up his hands to <hi>the throne of Grace</hi> (<hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16.) to receive thence <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> and then <hi>turn to the People,</hi> to pour it upon them. Thus on <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder the Angels ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared going up and down, <hi>up,</hi> to God; <hi>down,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:106095:71"/>to <hi>Jacob,</hi> a Type of what Prieſts do, when they officiate.</p>
               <p>But he gives them <hi>a ſhort Barbarian Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> That <hi>Benediction</hi> which you, a very civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed perſon, diſdain, as Barbarous, is taken out of Scripture, the words of an Angel to <hi>Gideon,</hi> (<hi>Judges</hi> 6.12.) <hi>Our Lord be with you, Dominus vobiſcum.</hi> Scripture it ſelf cannot eſcape your cenſure, if a Papiſt uſe it. Your contempt of the language of Angels in this World, will ſcarce make you worthy of their Company in the next.</p>

But a <hi>Turk</hi> ſays, it <hi>is fooliſh.</hi> Let it be ſo, no <hi>Turk</hi>'s Opinion is the Rule of my Faith. Is it of yours?

The World affords not a more convincing Inſtance of this flexibility of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, then that of your own Brethren in the late troubles; who brought it to countenance <hi>Sedition, Rebellion, Hereſie, Murther,</hi> and the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribleſt of all <hi>Murthers, Parricide,</hi> the killing of the <hi>Father of the Country.</hi> Did Scripture of it ſelf look towards (or abet) all thoſe crying Sins? no ſure, it condemns them formally.

               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:106095:72"/>
               <p>As for its being <hi>a ſource of Hereſies,</hi> it is not true, that Scriptures, do found Hereſies, or that Hereſies ſpring out of them, but that Men draw Hereſies out of the words of Scriptures, taken in a Senſe quite contrary to that of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. B. pag.</hi> 41. <q>Papiſts will have all the Authority of Scriptures to depend on the Church. A great difference is to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Teſtimony of a Witneſs, and the Authority of a Judge. The former is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to the Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Here you grant to the Church as much as we deſire, provided you own in this <hi>Witneſs</hi> ſuch a <hi>Veracity,</hi> as the nature of its <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony</hi> requires, to bring us to a <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted belief</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Curch never took upon her the Title <hi>Of Judge of Scripture.</hi> In her Councils, ſhe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the middle of the Aſſembly a high Throne as for Chriſt, and in it ſets the holy Ghoſpels as his word, according to which ſhe judges of the Doctrin tontroverted. <hi>Conc. Calced. Act.</hi> 1. <hi>So ſhe judges by Scriptures of the Doctrin of men; but doth not judg of the Scriptures themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the firſt Admiſſion of a Writing into the <hi>Canon of Scriptures,</hi> the Church proceding is of another nature. A Writing is brought to her, as written by a Man Divinely aſſiſted; of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> for example, to the <hi>Romans</hi> by <hi>Phebe,</hi> or to <hi>Philemon,</hi> by a fugitive Servant <hi>Oneſimus:</hi> neither, as a Witneſs, give any great credit to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:106095:73"/>the Writing they brought. The Paſtors of the flock of Chriſt conſider the Writings, examin the Meſſengers, recurr to God by Prayer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Aſſiſtance of his Holy Spirit, to know whether he were truly the Author of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting exhibited. If after all theſe means uſed to diſcover the Truth, they remain convinced, the thing was written by the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, they obey it themſelves, command Obedience to it, as to the Word of God, and uſe it as a <hi>Rule of Faith and Manners.</hi> So when an unknown Perſon brings into a Corporation a new Patent, as of the King's Majeſty, and preſents it to the Mayor: He (before he allows the Patentee to act in vertue of it,) with his Brethren conſiders the Writing, the Signet, the Seal, the Stile, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to know whether it be counterfeit or ſincere, with a Reſolution to obey it himſelf, and make others do the ſame, in caſe it appear to be truly the King's. The Mayor cannot be ſaid to judge of the Kings Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents (to which as a Subject he owes Obedience) but only to diſcern whether an unknown Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting be the King's Patent, or no.</p>
               <p>You ſay, this makes <hi>the Authority of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures depend on the Church.</hi> Which is as ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, as if you ſhould ſay, the Authority of the King's Patent depends on the Mayor of a pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Corporation, becauſe the Patent is exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, before it be executed. If any Man hath ſo little common Senſe, as not to diſcern the difference betwixt theſe two Propoſitions:
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106095:73"/>
                  <hi>To judge of the Kings Patent: and to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an unknown Writing be the Kings Patent:</hi> I am to ſeek how to help him.</p>
               <p>This Authority of the Church, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Scriptures as an undeniable Witneſs, occaſioned that Saying of S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> l. contra Epiſt. Fundam. c. 5. <hi>Ego Evangelio non crede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, niſi me Eccleſiae Catholicae commoveret autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas. I would not believe the Goſpel, did not the Authority of the Catholie Church move me to it.</hi> Which words are cited by all Catholic Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſts, as containing an implicit Deciſion of all our Controverſies; they ſhewing evidently S. <hi>Auguſtins</hi> Diſcourſe againſt the <hi>Manichees,</hi> to be juſt the ſame, which we uſe againſt the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Proteſtants, that as we are heirs of that Faith, which S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and the Church of his time defended againſt its Oppoſers the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Heretics, ſo are we of the Titles, by which they enjoyed it, and the Arms with which they defended it. I will put down the whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> at large, that ſo we may the better underſtand his meaning, and more convincingly ſhew how much the moſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of our Adverſaries are out of the way, in explicating it.</p>
               <p>The thing ſought for in that Diſcourſe was, whether <hi>Manichaeus</hi> was an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt or no? The <hi>Manichaeans</hi> ſaid he was: the Catholics denied it, for whoſe cauſe S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> diſputes thus in that place, <hi>Quaero quis ſit iſte Manichaeus?</hi> ſays he, <hi>Reſpondebitis, Apoſtolus

You anſwer, He is the Apoſtle of Chriſt. I will not take your word for it. What will you ſay, what means will you uſe to perſuade me? Perchance you will take the Goſpel, and thence endeavor to prove unto me the Miſſion of Manichaus. But what if you meet with one who doth not believe the Goſpel, how would you deal with him? For my part, I would not believe the Goſpel, did not the Authority of the Catholic Church move me. Whom therefore I obey, in ſaying, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Goſpel, ſhould I not obey, in ſaying, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not Manichaeus? Take your choice,</hi> whether you will have me rely on the Catholics, or no: <hi>If you ſay, Believe the Catholics; they marn me, not to believe you; wherefore believing them, I muſt reject you. If you ſay, Do not believe Catholics, you do not well, endeavoring to bring me to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in Manichaeus, by the Goſpel, which I received only upon the word of Catholics. If you ſay, you do well to believe the Catholics when they commend the Goſpel, but you do not well in believing them when they blame Manioheus: do you think me ſuch a Fool, as without any reaſon I ſhould believe what
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106095:75"/>pleaſes you, and not believe what you diſlike? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is much more reaſonable, ſeeing I muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Catholics, that I abandon your Communion, unleſs you can give me an evident Demonſtration for the contrary. Wherefore, if you will alledge Reaſon, lay by the Goſpel. If you retain the Goſpel, I will ſtick to thoſe upon whoſe word I have admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Goſpel: and their Authority forces me to renounce you. Now if perchance you can ſhew out of the Goſpel any evident proof of Manichaeus his Apoſtleſhip, you will indeed weaken in me the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Catholics, who forbid me to believe you. But that Authority being weakned, I ſhall no more be able to believe the Goſpel, which I received by it, and ſo whatſoever you prove thence, will fall to the ground. Therefore if no clear proof of Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus his Miſſion is extant in the Goſpel, I will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe the Catholics than you. If a clear proof be found there, I will neither believe the Catholics nor you: Not them, becauſe they were falſe in the Opinion they delivered of you; Not you, becauſe you rely on that Scripture which I received on the teſtimony of thoſe who have deceived me. Yet God forbid I ſhould reject the Goſpel; and believing it, I ſee no poſſibility of believing you.</hi> Thus the great Saint; which I have cited at large, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the whole Diſcourſe holds againſt all Hereſies, changing only the Name of <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus</hi> or <hi>Manichean,</hi> into that which ſignifies the Hereſie: as, for Example, into that of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> or <hi>Luther.</hi> Morcover, it contains a clear Confutation of what hath hitherto by the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106095:75"/>Learnedſt of our Adverſaries been ſaid in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it.</p>
               <p>The firſt Interpretation of this Place is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by <hi>W. L.</hi> in his Relation of a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, pag. 81. <hi>Some of your own,</hi> ſays he, <hi>will not endure it ſhould be underſtood, ſave of the Church in the time of the Apoſtles only;</hi> and then cites <hi>Ockam Dial. p.</hi> 1. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. Where he hath not one word of that. <hi>But,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Still.</hi> in his <hi>Rational Account, p.</hi> 198. <hi>the words are in Durandus, l.</hi> 3. <hi>Inſent. d.</hi> 24. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 9. where he ſays, <hi>Intelligitur ſolùm de Eccleſiâ, quae fuit tempore Apoſtolorum; It is underſtood only of the Church which was in the time of the Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame Author borrows another Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Biel, Lect.</hi> 2. <hi>in Can. Miſſae,</hi> That the words are to be underſtood of the Church in general, as it contains the firſt and later Ages, <hi>A tempore Chriſti &amp; Apoſtolorum, &amp;c.</hi> And to this he ſticks, for he adds, <hi>And ſo doth S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin take Eccleſ. contra Fund.</hi> And Dr. <hi>Still. p.</hi> 198, 199, approves the ſame, and confirms it out of <hi>Gerſon</hi> and <hi>Driedo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither of theſe two Explications can ſtand with the Text, as appears out of thoſe words: <hi>Quibus obtemperavi dicentibus, Credite Evangelio: cur eis non obtemperem dicentibus mihi, noli credere Manichaeo; Whom I obeyed in ſaying, Believe the Goſpel. ſhould I not obey in ſaying, Do not believe Manichaeus?</hi> Hence I frame this Argument: St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> profeſſeth he received the Goſpel upon the credit of that Church, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106095:76"/>
                  <hi>Manichaeus.</hi> But that Church which condemned <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> was that of his time, and not that of the Apoſtles, who never mentioned <hi>Manichaeus; Ergo</hi> the Church, on whoſe word he received the Goſpel, was that of his time, and not that of the Apoſtles. When therefore <hi>E. S. p.</hi> 220. ſays, <hi>It is plain St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>means not the Judgment of the preſent Church, but of the Catholic Church, as taking in all Ages and Places,</hi> he evidently contradicts the very Text of St. <hi>Auſtin:</hi> whence I conclude, that either he ſpeaks againſt his Conſcience, which I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to believe; or elſe (which is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable) that he had not read the Text which he undertakes to Explicate.</p>
               <p>A Third, and yet more improbable Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is delivered by <hi>W. L. p.</hi> 82. <hi>He ſpeaks it either of</hi> Novices <hi>or</hi> Doubters <hi>in the Faith, or elſe of ſuch as were in part</hi> Infidels. <hi>Mr.</hi> Fiſher <hi>the Jeſuit, at the Conference would needs have it, that</hi> St. Auſtin <hi>ſpake it even of the Faithful; which I cannot yet think: for he ſpeaks to the</hi> Manichees, <hi>and they had a great part of the</hi> Infidel <hi>in them. And the words immediately before theſe are, If thou ſhouldſt find one,</hi> qui Evangelio non credit, <hi>which did not believe the Goſpel, what wouldſt thou do to make him believe?</hi> Thus <hi>W. L.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is likewiſe plainly falſe; for S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was neither a <hi>Novice,</hi> nor a <hi>Doubter</hi> in the Faith, nor <hi>in part an Infidel,</hi> when he writ that Book; for he writ it after he was made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, as you may ſee <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Retract. c.</hi> 2. But
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:106095:76"/>he ſpeaks of himſelf, and deſcribes the ground of his own Faith; <hi>Ergo</hi> he doth not ſpeak of Novices, Doubters, or half Infidels, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the ground of their Faith, but of thoſe who are <hi>firm Believers.</hi> I prove that S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of his own Faith, and ſhews the ground on which it relied.: For firſt he ſays, <hi>I would not believe the Goſpels, without the Authority of Catholics commending them.</hi> Secondly he ſays, <hi>If you weaken the Authority of Catholics, I will reject the Goſpel.</hi> This I believe Mr. <hi>Stillingſt</hi> ſaw, and therefore ſaid, pag. 20. <hi>If you extend this beyond Novices and Weaklings, I ſhall not oppoſe you in it.</hi> And I cannot think that <hi>W. L.</hi> had read that place, at leaſt with attention, when he writ, <hi>He could not think S.</hi> Auſtin <hi>ſpoke of the Faithful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Stilling. pag. 220. <hi>Neither you, nor any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Author, is able to prove that S.</hi> Auſtin <hi>by theſe words ever dreamt of any infallible Authority in the preſent Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Seeing S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> expreſly ſays, <hi>He would renounce the Goſpel, if the Authority of Catholics were weakned in him, by diſcovering they had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered any one Lye,</hi> he muſt either think them exempt from all poſſibility of Lying, or elſe he adhered very looſly to the Goſpel. I hope <hi>E. S.</hi> will not aſſert the later part; wherefore he muſt grant, that S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> thought the Church free from all poſſibility of Error. Let us return to Mr. <hi>G. B.</hi>

               <p>And why, good Sir, ſhould the <hi>Infallibility in Expounding Scriptures</hi> be an Invaſion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic Office of Chriſt, ſeeing <hi>Infallibility in writing them</hi> was no ſuch thing?

               <p>But <hi>Her Expoſition muſt be admitted,</hi> ſay you, <hi>though contrary to the Senſe.</hi> As if <hi>Infallibility</hi> did not exclude all poſſibility of ſuch a wreſted Expoſition!

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:106095:80"/>muſt be expiated by our ſelves, either by Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in this Life, or in Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We hold indeed a temporal Pain due to Sin after it is remitted, ſometimes, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. For when Sin is remitted by <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> or by a <hi>perfect Act of Contrition,</hi> we believe all Pain to be remitted with the Sin; but not ordinarily. And for this reaſon the Church at all times made a difference betwixt thoſe whoſe Sins were expiated by the Sacrament of Baptiſm and of Penance; for ſhe never impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed any Penal Works on Baptized Perſons: and never omitted impoſing them on Penitents. Which ſhort hint points out ſuch <hi>a cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> teſtifying this Truth, that it covers the whole Face of the Primitive Church, and ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it, as to diſcover its Doctrin to be the ſame with ours.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be more clear to confirm this Catholic Doctrin, then that a temporal Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty was inflicted on <hi>David</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">2. Reg. 12.14.</note> for that Sin, which upon his crying <hi>Peccavi,</hi> had been <hi>removed, put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> or <hi>forgiven.</hi> A <hi>Penalty</hi> therefore or <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> may be inflicted for a Sin forgiven, and conſequently a Pain is due ſometimes to it.</p>
               <p>Indeed were it not ſo, why did our Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers impoſe large Penances, after by vertue of the Keys the Sins were remitted? why do you blame us for impoſing ſmall Penances, when there is, as you ſay here, none at all due?</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 54. <hi>This is contrary to the value we
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106095:81"/>ſet on the Blood of Chriſt.</hi> Epheſ. 2.15, 16. <hi>By Chriſt Peace is made, we are reconciled to God, he preſents us to the Father without ſpot, wrinkle,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which declare how plenary his Satisfaction was, nothing being left undone by him for removing the guilt of ſin.</hi> Thus you. As if nothing could be required on Man's ſide, in order to apply the Satisfaction of Chriſt, without derogating from its plenitude! Chriſt's Satisfaction was <hi>plenary:</hi> ſo was his Prayer, his Grief, his Suffering. Yet we muſt pray for our ſelves<note n="(a)" place="margin">Matt. 6.12.</note>, and for one another,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Jac. 5.16</note> althô he prayed for us all. And we muſt be ſorry for our Sins, the whole courſe of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel requires it of us; and we muſt ſuffer for and with him. For as in order of Nature that Action of the prime Cauſe, by which it concurs with Creatures, is ſufficient of it ſelf to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the whole Effect, yet nothing is done without the concourſe of ſecondary Cauſes, which apply the Action of the firſt: ſo the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Chriſt is ſufficient for all, yet doth not remit our ſins actually, without it be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to us, either by Baptiſm, or Penitential Works. And the neceſſity of this Application by Faith, is owned by all your Reformers: And if this is conſiſtent with that <hi>Fulneſs,</hi> why not Application by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Charity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſay, <hi>This is a comfortleſs Doctrin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is our Duty to take the Doctrin of Chriſt as we find it in holy Writ, and to teach others what we take thence, being aſſured, that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:106095:81"/>whether it he, or be not <hi>comfortable,</hi> it is <hi>wholſom</hi> unto everlaſting Life. And ſuch is that <hi>Doctrin,</hi> which makes us puniſh in our ſelves our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and by that means prevent thoſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which God would otherwiſe inflict up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us: it makes us <hi>work our ſalvation with</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>G.B. pag.</hi> 55. begins to treat of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and doth it ſo lightly, as if he feared to burn his Fingers. Yet if he ſhews leſs <hi>Reading,</hi> he ſhews more <hi>Cunning</hi> than his Brethren, <hi>E. S.</hi> or <hi>W. L.</hi> who give great advantages to an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, by fixing a time for the kindling of that purging Fire, which was lighted long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any determinate time they can fix upon. Mr. <hi>Stillingfl.</hi> pag. 654. <hi>Not one of the Fathers affirmed your Doctrin of Purgatory before</hi> Gregory <hi>the Firſt.</hi> Yet <hi>W. L.</hi> allows it a much greater
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:106095:82"/>Antiquity, pag. 353. <hi>We can find,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a beginning of this Doctrin, and a Beginner too, namely</hi> Origen. Thus they differ among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and as little agree each with himſelf: for pag. 348. <hi>W. L.</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Scarce any Father within the firſt Three hundred years, ever thought of it.</hi> Which Aſſertion is contradictory to what he ſays of <hi>Origen</hi>'s being the <hi>Beginner of it:</hi> and it is moreover very raſh; for doth he think that all the Fathers of the firſt three Ages writ down all their <hi>thoughts?</hi> or that all they writ is preſerved till our days? or that he hath ſeen all that is ſo preſerved? or remembers all that he hath ever ſeen? But let us leave theſe Men to reconcile together their own thoughts, which will be no ſmall nor ſhort labor, and examin the thing it ſelf: And to come to it, I paſs over ſeveral ſlips of our Adverſaries, v.g. <hi>W. Laud,</hi> pag. 348. ſays, that <hi>The firſt Definition of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> to be believed as a <hi>Divine Truth,</hi> was made by the Council of <hi>Florence.</hi> In which he is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken: for <hi>Benedict XII.</hi> long before that, had Defined the ſame.</p>
               <p>I prove, that the Primitive Church believed a <hi>Purgatory</hi> in the moſt pure Times, out of the Teſtimony of three Fathers, S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nyſſen,</hi> and S. <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:106095:83"/>
               <p>S. Gregory Nyſſen,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Greg. orat. de mortuis.</note> as cited by <hi>W. L.</hi> pag. 351. <hi>Men muſt be purged either by Prayers, or by the Furnace of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory Fire after this Life.</hi> Again. <hi>A Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be partaker of the Divine Nature, unleſs the Purging Fire doth take away the Stains that are in his Soul.</hi> Again. <hi>After this Life, a Purgatory Fire takes away the Blots, and Propenſity to Evil. W. L.</hi> conſidering theſe words, ingenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, <hi>they ſeem plain.</hi> Yet he holds out one Buckler againſt theſe two Arrows drawn out of the Quivers of thoſe Fathers, That they ſpeak of a Purgation of ſins; and in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church we are taught to believe only a Purgation of the pain due to ſins already forgiven. Now this avails little. 1. Becauſe the <hi>Debt of pain</hi> may be, and often is taken for ſin, (on which it is grounded) <hi>metonimicè.</hi> 2. He ſeems not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand our Doctrin; for there is no Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Church obliging us to believe, that there remain no venial ſins in <hi>Purgatory.</hi> Hence Dr. <hi>Kelliſon,</hi>
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">Kelliſ. in <hi>3,</hi> p. tom. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>611.</hi>
                  </note> late Preſident of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colledge of <hi>Doway,</hi> proves <hi>Purgatory</hi> to be prepared Firſt, for thoſe who die with only venial ſins. Secondly, for thoſe who die without any ſin, but only without having fully ſatisfied for the pains due to ſins forgiven. The ſame reaſons are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by Dr. <hi>Sylvius,</hi>
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">Sylvius in <hi>3.</hi> p. Suppl. q. <hi>100.</hi> p. <hi>356.</hi>
                  </note> where he treats the ſame Queſtion. And before theſe, <hi>Benedictus XII.</hi> in his Decree <hi>Benedictus Deus,</hi> hath theſe words: <hi>Decer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimus
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:106095:83"/>animas decedentes cum veniali aliquo peccato, purgari poſt mortem, &amp; poſt purgationem, ante re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptionem ſuorum corporum, &amp; judicium generale, poſt Aſcenſionem Chriſti Domini, fuiſſe, eſſe, &amp; futur as eſſe in coelo. We do declare, that Souls dying in venial Sin, being purged after their Death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the general Reſurrection are tranſlated to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Which Decree you may find in <hi>Magno Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lario,</hi> and in <hi>Alphonſ. de Caſtro verbo Beatitudo.</hi> You ſee, Sir, that there is nothing in the <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory</hi> deſcribed by thoſe Saints incoſiſtent with what we are taught to believe of ours. So <hi>W. L.</hi> or his Squire <hi>E. S.</hi> muſt ſtudy for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Evaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>W. L.</hi> cites indeed the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> to confirm his Anſwer. But that place helps only to convince the World how perfunctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly he read, and inconſiderately framed his Judgment upon reading: for in the place cited by him, the Council ſpeaks of Souls dying in <hi>the ſtate of Grace,</hi> or <hi>Charity, Si in Charitate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſerint:</hi> But of their not having any venial ſins, not one word, unleſs he thinks that all Souls in Grace are free from venial ſins, which will be another proof of his Abilities in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</p>
               <p>My next Proof is taken from St. <hi>Anguſtin,</hi> in Enchir. cap. 110. <hi>Neque negandum eſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functorum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>imas pietate ſuorum viventium rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vari, cùm pro illis ſacrificium mediatoris offertur, vel Eleemoſynae in Eccleſiâ fiunt, ſed iis haec pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt, qui cùm viverent, ut haec ſibi postea prodeſſe
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:106095:84"/>poſſent, meruerunt. Eſt enim quidam vivendi mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus nec tam bonus, ut non requirat iſta poſt mortem, nec tam malus, ut ei non proſint iſta poſt mortem. Eſt verò talis in bono, ut iſta non requirat, &amp; eſt rurſus talis in malo, ut nec his valeat, cùm ex hac vitâ tranſierit, adjuvari.</hi> Similia habentur l. 21. de Civ. Dei c. 24. <hi>It ought not to be denied, that Souls departed are caſed by the Piety of their ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Friends, when the Sacrifice of our Mediator is offered for them, or Alms given in the Church. But thoſe are relieved by theſe helps, who lived ſo as to deſerve the benefit of them after their death: for there is a kind of Life neither ſo good, as not to need them, nor ſo bad, as not to receive eaſe by them. There is another ſo good, as not to want them, and a third ſo bad, as to be incapable of help, even from them.</hi> Thus S. <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where you ſee, he diſtinguiſhes three Places for the Souls departed, as clearly as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> or the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> One of thoſe ſo good, as not to need help by the Suffrages of the Church, ſuch are the Bleſſed Souls in Heaven. Another ſo bad, as to be incapable or unworthy of relief by the Suffrages, ſuch are the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Souls in Hell. A third needing them, and capable of eaſe from them, ſuch are Souls in Purgatory.</p>
               <p>You ſee Secondly, clear mention of <hi>the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of our Mediator,</hi> offered by the Church in his days. What is this, but our <hi>Maſs?</hi> which you may find again <hi>Lib.</hi> 10. <hi>de Civitat. Dei. cap.</hi> 20.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:106095:84"/>
               <p>You ſee Thirdly, this <hi>Sacrifice offered for the Dead.</hi> And Laſtly, you ſee Alms given in the Church, for the relief and eaſe of deceaſed Friends: How many Points of our <hi>Reformers Catechiſm</hi> doth this one place confute! Truly one may think, either that they invented theſe Doctrins to ſpite <hi>S. Auſtin,</hi> or that this great Saint writ that Chapter with a Prophetic Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to convince the World that your Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are no leſs oppoſit to the ancient than to the modern Church, which both agree in hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the ſame Tenets in <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>E. Still. pag. 642. <hi>S.</hi> Auſtin <hi>delivers his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with ſuch fear and heſitancy, that any one may eaſily ſee, that he was far from making it an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Faith.</hi> He may as well ſay, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> ſpoke with heſitancy. He adds: <hi>That in S,</hi> Auſtin<hi>'s time, many favored</hi> Origen<hi>'s Opinion, of the final Salvation of all, at leaſt who died in the Communion of the Church.</hi> But what is this to <hi>S. Auſtin,</hi> who condemns that Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Opinion, as he ſays, and may be ſeen <hi>lib.</hi> 21. <hi>de Civ. Dei cap.</hi> 24. and in the whole Book <hi>De fide &amp; operibus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſays <hi>E.S.</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks doubtfully, <hi>lib. de fide &amp; operibus cap.</hi> 16. <hi>&amp; Enchir. cap.</hi> 69. But he ſhould have taken notice, that he ſpeaks in thoſe places not of Purgatory in it ſelf, but of a particular pain, which we, no leſs than he, doubt of. The matter he treats, <hi>Enchir. c.</hi> 68. is the Grief which Men feel for the loſs of ſuch things which they loved inordinately, and by
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:106095:85"/>that means offended God, althô their love to Creatures were not ſo great as to withdraw them from the Foundation, Chriſt. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rit eum rerum dolor, quas dilexerat amiſſarum; ſed non ſubvertit fundamenti ſtabilitate munitum. Such a Man is burnt, and tormented with the loſs of thoſe things which he loved; yet he is not quite conſumed, becauſe the Foundation ſtands faſt,</hi> viz. his Love to Chriſt, whom he would ſtick to, althó with loſs of other things. Then follows <hi>cap.</hi> 69. where he doubts whether ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Fire, or Pain as this is, ſhall accompany them in the next World; that is, whether Souls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted retain any diſorderly affection to their Poſſeſſions in this World, by reaſon of which the want of them may be a torment to them, and as it were, burn them. In a like manner <hi>lib. de fide operibus cap.</hi> 16. <hi>Sivè ergò in hac vita tantum, homines iſta patiuntur,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſivè poſt hanc vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam talia quaedam judicia ſubſequuntur. Whether Men ſuffer ſuch things only in this Life, or the ſame Torments accompany them into the next World.</hi> Which is a thing modern Catholics as much doubt of as <hi>S. Auſtin;</hi> yet he, as well as we, might believe moſt certainly, what he ſo poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively affirmed in his Manual, Chap. CX.</p>
               <p>In vain therefore doth <hi>E. S.</hi> alledge, p. 653. the blotting out of thoſe words, <hi>Conſtat animas poſt hanc vitam purgari; It is evident that Souls are purged after this Life.</hi> There is enough left in <hi>S. Auſtin</hi>'s undoubted works to confute his Error. So the ſucceſs of that Reformer was
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:106095:85"/>like that of <hi>Marcion</hi> with his Sponge, who blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out ſome parts of Scripture, yet what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained confuted his Hereſie.</p>
               <p>As for Holy Scripture, I think the Argument which S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> uſes, <hi>lib.</hi> 21. <hi>de Civ. Dei cap.</hi> 23. very convincing for <hi>Purgatory.</hi> It is taken out of the words of our Saviour, <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.32. <hi>It ſhall be forgiven neither in this world nor in the next.</hi> Whence it follows, that ſome ſins are forgiven in the next world. <hi>Neque enim de qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſdam veraciter diceretur, quod non eis remittatur, neque in hoc ſaeculo, neque in futuro ſaeculo, niſi eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, quibus etſi non in iſto, tamen remittetur in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turo.</hi> Aug. l. 21. de Civit.

               </p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 55. <hi>For Purgatory, the Proof from Scripture was only drawn from one wreſted place of the Apoſtle Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> How can you ſay this, when amongſt the Ancients S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> uſes another Text, as we have juſt now ſeen. And <hi>Bellarmin</hi> hath Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Texts of Scripture, as your Patriarch <hi>W. L.</hi> will tell you, pag. 353.</p>
               <p>G. B. <hi>The Apoſtles words contain only a Prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bial form of Speech, to expreſs the riſque they run.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks not only of <hi>a riſque,</hi> or hazard, but of an effectual loſs; <hi>He ſhall ſuffer loſs,</hi> ſays he, Verſ. 15.</p>
               <p>G. B. pap. 55. <hi>Many Viſions and Apparitions were vouched for the proof of Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

               <p>I think not our Divine Faith much concerned in aſſerting the truth of any purely Human Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory; and I think moſt Apparitions to be ſuch.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:106095:86"/>it together, with an Anſwer to it, in S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> lib. 1. de Poen. cap. 2. <hi>Aiunt Novatiani ſe Domino deferre reverentiam, cui ſoli remitten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorum criminum poteſtatem reſervant. Imò nulli majorem injuriam faciunt quàm qui volunt ejus mandata reſcindere. Nam cùm ipſe in Evangelio dixerit, quaecunque ligaveritis: quis eſt qui eum magis honorat, utrum qui mandatis ejus obtemperat, an qui reſiſtit? Eccleſia in utroque ſervat obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, ut peccatum &amp; alliget, &amp; relaxet. The</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians (ſays this Saint) <hi>pretend to honor God, by reſerving to him alone the power of forgiving ſins. But really none are more injurious to him,</hi> (or wrong him more) <hi>than thoſe who break his Orders. For whereas he in the Goſpel ſaid, Whoſe ſins ſoever you bind; who honors God more, he who obeys his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> by uſing that Power, <hi>or he who reſiſts them? Now the Church obeys both the Commands,</hi> to bind and looſe ſins, <hi>effectually binding and looſing them.</hi> Thus S. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee, Sir, that our Doctrin now was that of the Church in S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s time; That the <hi>Novatians</hi> held your Doctrin, and made uſe of the ſame pretext as you do, to defend their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin. The Church, for which S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> pleads, was Catholic: ſo muſt we be in this, ſeeing our Doctrin is the ſame with theirs. The <hi>Novatians</hi> in this were <hi>Heretics;</hi> what are you?</p>

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:106095:87"/>dwell on Earth,</hi> ſays he, <hi>are enabled to diſpenſe the things in Heaven. To them a Power is given, which neither Angels, nor Archangels enjoy: for to theſe it was never ſaid, What you ſhall bind. Earthly Princes have power to caſt into Priſon, but their Power is reſtrained to Bodies only. Whereas the Bond we ſpeak of, reaches the Soul, and Heaven it ſelf, inſomuch as what Prieſts do below, God ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies above: and the Lord confirms the Sentence of the Servant. And what is this, but to have put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands all Power to diſpoſe of Heaven? whoſe ſins you forgive, are forgiven: and whoſe ſins you retain, are retained, What Power can be greater than this? God the Father hath given all Power to Judge to the Son, and the Son hath communicated all that ſame Power to Prieſts.</hi> Thus the glorious Saint.</p>
               <p>You ſee, Sir, the Grounds of our Belief in this Point, the clear words of our Lord,<note n="(a)" place="margin">

                  <hi>Whoſe ſoever ſins you remit, they are remitted unto them;</hi> You ſee the Fathers and the Primitive Church Explicating thoſe words as we do; You ſee <hi>Novatians</hi> were held for Heretics for underſtanding thoſe words otherwiſe; What ground have you to deny a Truth delivered by Chriſt to the Apoſtles, and from them handed down to us?</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 62. <hi>It was counted a Blaſphemy in Chriſt, when he ſaid, Thy ſins are forgiven thee, which ſhews it to be Blaſphemy in all others, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an invaſion of his Prerogative.</hi>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:106095:88"/>of the Scribes againſt Jeſus Chriſt, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt the clear words of Chriſt, and the meaning of the whole Church; Nay, their words, althô full of malice, and convinced of Falſhood by a Miracle, are preferred before thoſe of Chriſt, as being made a Rule by which his muſt be interpreted. Thus under pretence of aſſerting the Authority of Chriſt, you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it, as your Brethren ruined their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, under pretence of making him a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous King.</p>

               <p>G. B. pag. 61, 62. <hi>What can take off more from the value of the Death of Chriſt, than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it in the power of a Prieſt to abſolve from ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That cannot take from the value of that Sacred Paſſion, upon which it is built.

                     <q>I take a delight, O my Lord, to confeſs to thee, with what inward Goads thou
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:106095:92"/>didſt ſubdue me, and by what Means thou didſt bring me down, levelling the greater and leſſer Mountains of my Thoughts! How thou didſt ſtreighten my crookedneſs, and ſmooth my roughneſs! Into what Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did I break out, O my God, when I read the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> thoſe faithful Canticles, thoſe pious Sounds, which baniſh all proud Spirits! How I cried out in reading them!

                  </p>
                  <p>See what a difference there is betwixt the Sentiments of this great Saint, and yours. Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pſalms moved the Saint to <hi>Compunction;</hi> it moves you to <hi>Laughter.</hi> It ſtirred up in the Saint the Love of God; you are not moved to any good by it. The Saint would read them to all the World; you are diſpleaſed they are recommended to any. He thought reading them a great Antidote againſt the Pride of Mankind, which is the root of all Evil; and you ſay it is Ridiculous. You have reaſon to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect your ſpirit, which is found ſo often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Spirit of God.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THIS is a third Inſtance of our ridiculous Penances, <hi>going to ſuch Churches,</hi> ſay you.

                  <p>The two firſt great ſins committed after the Creation of the World by <hi>Adam,</hi> in eating the forbidden Fruit, and <hi>Cain,</hi> in killing his Brother, were Judged by their Creator, and a great part of their Penance preſcribed by that Great <hi>Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentier,</hi> was a <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> or Baniſhment, from the Place where the ſin was committed.

                     </note> aſſures, that this is the ground why ſuch a Penance was enjoyned. And methinks the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of God himſelf may be a ſufficient War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for his Delegates, Prieſts, in following ſuch a Precedent, and ſecure them againſt your Cenſure; eſpecially ſeeing in the moſt ancient Collections of <hi>Penitential Canons</hi> made by <hi>Bede, Theodorus, Burchardus, Ivo,</hi> and <hi>Gratian,</hi> we find <hi>Pilgrimages</hi> preſcribed amongſt other Penances. Which ſhews the unanimous Conſent of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. And you may much eaſilier diſcover your own <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> or lack of Vertue, than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Makers or Collectors of thoſe Canons of <hi>Folly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reaſons for this Penance are chiefly
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:106095:93"/>three. Firſt, It is a kind of Baniſhment, which ſeparates a Man (for a time) from Friends, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, Home and Country: which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be painful, laying aſide the Incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of Travelling. And it ſeems juſt, that he who abuſed thoſe things, ſhould be deprived of the comfort of them; and having ſcandalized his Neighbors by bad Example, might edifie them by undergoing this <hi>public Penance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second, It is a connatural Remedy for ſuch ſins, (to which two or more concur, and which proceed many times from the Perſon we converſe with, or preſent Occaſion) to remove the Sinner from ſuch Occaſions and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; as all know, who deal with Conſciences. Now this is done by <hi>Pilgrimages.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third Reaſon is, That althô God be in all Places, and ſees and hears us whereſoever we are; yet he doth not alike in all Places diſcloſe his <hi>Power</hi> by Miracles, nor his <hi>Juſtice</hi> by diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſecret Sins, nor his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> by Converſion of Sinners, as <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> obſerved long ſince, and daily experience confirms. <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> notes ſuch to have been in his time the Tomb of <hi>S. Felix</hi> at <hi>Nola</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> and that of the glorious Martyrs at <hi>Milan.</hi> He refers this to the ſecret Judgment of God, humbly acknowledging his own Ignorance. <hi>Aug. Epiſt.</hi> 137. <hi>

Verum tamen ad iſta quae hominibus nota ſunt, quis poteſt ejus conſilium per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrutari, quare in aliis locis haec miracula fiant, in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:106095:93"/>aliis non fiant?</hi> And I am content to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my ignorance in imitation of him, when nothing appears in the place it ſelf, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there doth. For if any Man, who hath any <hi>lively Faith</hi> within him, ſhould enter <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and ſee the Place where the Lamb of God was Sacrificed, and the Price of our Redemption paid; Innocency condemned, the Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom derided for Folly, the King of Glory crowned with Thorns, the Creator ſcoffed, ſcorned by his Creatures, God dying, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that painful and ignominious Death of the Croſs. When he ſhould think, <hi>Here</hi> his Fleſh was torn with Stripes; <hi>Here</hi> his Head was crowned with Thorns; <hi>Here</hi> thoſe Hands, which wrought ſo many Miracles, were pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with Nails; <hi>here</hi> thoſe Feet, ſo often wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in ſeeking the loſt Sheep, were fixed to the Croſs; <hi>Here</hi> that Tongue, which had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over the Elements, and Death and Hell, was imbued with Vineger and Gall; <hi>Here</hi> his Side was opened, the laſt drop of Blood ſpilt, the Life of the World died, to raiſe to Life the World. When he conſiders this, and withal, that his own ſins had ſo great a ſhare in requiring this <hi>moſt abundant Redemption,</hi> will not the very Place ſuggeſting theſe and more thoughts, fix his Imagination, quicken his Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, detain his Underſtanding, and ſtir up his Will, to <hi>a hatred</hi> of Sin, the cauſe of all this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Judgment upon the unſpotted Lamb; to <hi>confuſion,</hi> for having contributed ſo much to it
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:106095:94"/>by his own Offences; and to <hi>love God</hi> above all things, who hath loved us ſo much.</p>
                  <p>Hereafter, before yot throw ſuch hard Stones at our Heads, conſider whether there be not with us mingled, by a communion of Sentiments, ſome Perſons to whom you muſt own great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to be due.</p>
                  <p>I have brought you here into an Aſſembly of the chiefeſt Preachers and Prelates of all Ages, all teaching, commanding, or practiſing theſe Works which you deride. The Apoſtles take up the firſt rank, and over all <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, God bleſſed for evermore,</hi> Preſiding, and giving Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. Suppoſe in the name of all theſe S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> or S. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle ſhould thus ſpeak unto you:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How comes it to paſs, that you preſume to cenſure in thoſe of your Days, that which they practiſe only in Imitation of us? How dare you ſay, that our Exerciſes</hi> ſhould kill the Vitals of Religion, and dull the Apprehenſions of Sin? <hi>That what Chriſt did himſelf, and what is done by others following his footſteps,</hi> ſhould lead from Chriſt, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earneſt Application to him?</p>
                  <p>What Anſwer can you make to theſe true Reproaches? Think a little ſadly on this, and it will bring you to a Temper more beſeeming your Coat, than when you writ what I have here Anſwered.</p>

               <p>G. B. p. 64. <hi>ANother oppoſition made to the Prieſtly Office of Chriſt, is their conceit of the Sacrifice of the</hi> Maſs, <hi>which they believe is a Formal Expiation of Sins both for the Living and Dead, who are in Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You fall ſo often, that it would tire any Man to take you up always. It is not true, that Catholics hold <hi>Maſs</hi> to be a <hi>Formal Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Sins. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nica cauſa formalis; The only Formal Cauſe of our Juſtification,</hi> ſays the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent,</hi> Seſſ. 6. cap. 7. <hi>is the Juſtice of God, by which he makes us juſt.</hi> That is, it is habitual Grace or Charity. But let that paſs.</p>
               <p>We ſay with the Fathers, that <hi>Maſs</hi> is an <hi>Expiatory Sacrifice.</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin, Enchir. cap.</hi> 110. following his Diſtinction of Souls deceaſed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three Claſſes, thoſe in Heaven, thoſe in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and thoſe in Hell, he ſays, that Maſſes for the firſt are <hi>Thankſgivings;</hi> for the ſecond, <hi>Expiations, Propitiationes ſunt;</hi> for the third, not eaſe to the Dead, but ſome comfort to their living Friends. <hi>Pro valdè bonis, gratiarum actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſunt; pro non valdè malis, propitiatione ſunt: pro valdè malis, etſi nulla adjumenta mortuorum, qualeſcunque vivorum conſolationes ſunt.</hi> Enchir. cap. 110.</p>
               <p>To clear yet more this Point of the <hi>Sacrifice
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:106095:95"/>of the Maſs,</hi> and of Chriſt offered, and offering himſelf in it, hear S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> lib. 10. de Civit. Dei, cap. 20. <hi>Verus ille Mediator in quantum for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam ſervi accipiens, mediator effectus eſt Dei &amp; hominum, homo Chriſtus Jeſus, cùm in formâ Dei ſacrificium cum Patre ſumat, cum quo &amp; unus Deus eſt, tamen in formâ ſervi ſacrificium maluit eſſe, quàm ſumere, ne vel hac occaſione quiſquam exiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maret cuilibet ſacrificandum eſſe creaturae. Per hoc &amp; Sacerdos eſt, ipſe offerens, ipſe &amp; oblatio. Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus rei Sacramentum quotidianum eſſe voluit Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae ſacrificium.</hi> 
                  <q>The true Mediator, by taking upon himſelf the ſhape of a Servant, being made Mediator betwixt God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who together with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (with whom he is one God) as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Sacrifice, but as a Man will have no Sacrifice offered to himſelf, to cut off all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Sacrificing to any but God. In this Sacrifice he is the Prieſt, he is the Sacrificer, and he is himſelf the Sacrifice. (Or he is the Perſon who offers, and he is the Oblation.) And he hath ordered the Sacrifice of the Church, as a daily Commemoration or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Sacrifice of the Croſs.</q> Thus he.</p>
               <p>Where you ſee a Sacrifice of the Church, as a daily Commemoration of that of the Croſs; That Chriſt offers it; That he himſelf is offerd in it, and all this to God, no Sacrifice being offered to any elſe.</p>
               <p>If you are ſo hard to pleaſe, as to be ſatisfied with none but thoſe of your Communion, ſee

               </p>
               <p>G. B. pag. d. 6. &amp; 65. <hi>To imagine that the Prieſts going through the Office of the</hi> Maſs, <hi>and his receiving the Conſecrated Elements, can have a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to expiate the Sins of others, eſpecially of the Dead, is a thing ſo contrary to moſt common Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, that it will puzzle a Mans Belief to think any can credit it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Your <hi>common Impreſſions</hi> differ very much from thoſe of other Men; ſo you have much reaſon to ſuſpect, that they are only <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in name, but in reality they are only <hi>private Conceits</hi> of your own Head. The Catholic Church believes what you think <hi>none believes;</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> believed it, all Catholics profeſs it, our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils define it, our Catechiſms teach it, our Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits preach it, and our Paſtors proclaim it. Yet you would fain perſuade the World no body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it, that the thing is incredible. As if you knew better what paſſes in our Hearts than we our ſelves. But if this be not an <hi>honeſt way,</hi> it is at leaſt, <hi>cunning,</hi> to take for granted what you cannot prove; and it is eaſier to find a Sleight to ſteal into your weak Readers Opinions, than to gain it by any ſubſtantial Reaſon.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We do not believe the Paſſion of Chriſt to be applied by the Prieſts taking the Hoſt, but by the eſſential part of the Sacrifice, which conſiſts in another Action.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 65. <hi>It is abſurd to think one Man's Action can be derived to another.</hi>

And what ſhall I ſay of the Death of the Croſs, when his very Diſciples diſowned him?</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 67. <hi>What low thoughts of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt it breed in ſuch Minds as are capable of believing this Contrivance?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You ſpeak like a Pagan, to whom the <hi>Croſs of Chriſt is folly,</hi> (1 Cor. 1.23.) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than like a Chriſtian, to whom <hi>Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified</hi> (that is, under the greateſt Humiliation) <hi>is the vertue and wiſdom of God.</hi> We who have learnt to look on him as <hi>God bleſſed for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> even when on the Croſs and dying, we can take out of all his Humiliations occaſion to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire his Love, and adore his Goodneſs to us; but not to diſeſteem his Perſon, or diminiſh our thoughts of his Majeſty. And let me tell you, you are the firſt Chriſtian, I know of, who ever
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:106095:98"/>made ſuch Unchriſtian Reflections on the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations of the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. B. pag.</hi> 67, 68, 69, <hi>&amp;</hi> 70. In theſe you charge us with three Crimes. 1. With ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Laws of Chriſt. 2. Diſpenſing with the Laws of God. And 3. Commanding things indifferent, contrary to <hi>Chriſtian Liberty.</hi> I anſwer to the Firſt and Third, the Apoſtles did the ſame, (<hi>Acts</hi> 15.29.) forbidding <hi>ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled Meat and Blood,</hi> which were things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and not forbidden by the Law of Chriſt. And as to your Objection, that <hi>this intrenches upon Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> I Anſwer out of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon very dear to you, even your ſelf, in your <hi>Vindication,</hi> Confer. 2. p. 172. <hi>Chriſtian Liberty is ſtated in an Exemption from the Laws of Moſes.</hi> Shew that we impoſe <hi>the Law of Moſes,</hi> and you will ſay ſomething to the purpoſe, to our <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching upon Chriſtian Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Diſpenſing in Divine Laws,</hi> when you prove what you object, I will conſider what to anſwer. Your Inſtances are not ſufficient. For firſt, as for <hi>Diſpenſing of Vows,</hi> there is an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in them, as in Laws, which is an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of ſome Circumſtances, in which they do not oblige. For Example, a Man vows to faſt next <hi>Lent</hi> with Bread and Water, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time falls ſick, and continues ſo, why may not the Church declare his Vow not to oblige, or change it into ſomething elſe? <hi>Item</hi> he vows a Pilgrimage, and his Wife, Family and Affairs require his preſence at home. If this
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:106095:98"/>doth not ſatisfie you, call to mind the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of your firſt Reformers, who opened all Cloiſters, and diſpenſed with ſo many Vows at one time. Is it not ſtrange, that you ſhould charge us with <hi>Diſpenſing with ſome Vows,</hi> when you annul all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Diſſolving Wedlock Bond.</hi> I know none who practiſe diſſolving conſummated Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages. If you do, accuſe them; if you do not, ask pardon for this falſe Accuſation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Allowing Marriages in forbidden Degrees.</hi> The Degrees hindring Marriage were contained in the Ceremonial Law, which expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Chriſt, the end of that Law. Thoſe which now bind, are eſtabliſhed by Canon Law, which was made, and doth depend on the Church.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Communion under one Kind, or, <hi>The Chalice taken from the People contrary to the Command of Chriſt.</hi> You can never prove <hi>that Command</hi> to all, to drink of the Cup.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 71. <hi>Another Invaſion of the Regal Power, is the Pope's pretence to be univerſal Biſhop, which is termed by S.</hi> Gregory <hi>the Great to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I know no Pope who pretends to it, I know none who give it them: If there be any ſuch, let them anſwer for themſelves. The Popes are ſo far from pretending to that Title, that to this day in our Canon Law it is expreſly condemned. <hi>C. Nullus, &amp; C. Ecce, D.</hi> 99. And I challenge you, or any Man elſe, to ſhew me any
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:106095:99"/>one Pope, who ever required it of others, or took it to himſelf. <hi>Du-Val,</hi> a Learned Doctor of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> cenſures that Title as ſeverely as any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> can do, who yet is eſteemed as great a Favorer of the Papal Grandeur, as any of the Faculty of <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I deſire you to make good Senſe of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing you ſay. Firſt, pag. 67. <hi>Chriſt hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us from the bondage of corruption.</hi> How is this done already, when the Apoſtle, (whoſe words thoſe are, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21.) promiſes it only after the Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Secondly, pag. 68. <hi>Anathema is the mildeſt of the Spiritual Cenſures we thunder againſt ſuch as comply not with our tyranny.</hi> What <hi>Spiritual Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> is more ſevere? I think that the ſevereſt of all, as we believe after <hi>Tertul. Apolog. cap.</hi> 39. <hi>pag.</hi> 68.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, p. 69. <hi>No Authority beſides Chriſt can reach the Conſcience.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> was of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent opinion, when he enjoins Obedience to the Commands of Princes, <hi>not only for wrath, but for Conſcience.</hi>

Your Words and Phraſes are great and high, your Reaſon and Senſe low and little; yet that delivered with ſo much Confidence as may perſuade your ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and credulous Reader you have Reaſon on your ſide, when you are to ſeek in the firſt Principles of the Matter you Diſcourſe on.

If what I have written already, and what I ſhall write, doth not make this clear, I will give you leave to apply that Compariſon to me.</p>
               <p>I have already ſpoken (Chap. 3. &amp; 4.) of the

                  <hi>Deſigns</hi> of God in delivering <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> that it was to teach Men to ſerve God in this Life, and enjoy him in the next.

This I have ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, yet I again repeat it for their ſakes, who ſo ſet up the Merits of <hi>Faith,</hi> as to neglect <hi>Good-works,</hi> without which <hi>Faith is dead,</hi> (Jac. 2.17.) and place it before <hi>Charity,</hi> without which <hi>Faith avails nothing,</hi> (1 Cor. 13.)

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:106095:103"/>would ſee the Seat due to <hi>Charity,</hi> the Queen of Vertues, which ſeems at preſent hidden from <hi>the Eyes of thoſe wiſe and prudent Men,</hi> yet <hi>is revealed to little ones.</hi>

                  <p>Here is then the Tenure of our Faith. <hi>The Father ſent his only begotten Son, conſubſtantial to himſelf, into the World: And</hi> what he heard of his Father, that he made known to us, (<hi>Joan.</hi> 15.15.) <hi>The Father and Son ſent the Holy Ghoſt; And</hi> he did not ſpeak of himſelf, but what he heard, that he ſpoke, (<hi>Joan.</hi> 16.13.) <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſent the Apoſtles; And</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto us what they had ſeen and heard, (1 <hi>Joan.</hi> 1.3.) <hi>The Apoſtles ſent the Higheſt and lower Prelates in the Church, and the Rule by which they framed their Decrees, was,</hi> Let nothing be altered in the <hi>Depoſitum;</hi> let no Innovation be admitted in what is delivered: <hi>Quod traditum eſt non innovetur.

                  </p>
                  <p>By this we are aſſured, that our Faith is that which the Councils received from the Apoſtles, the Apoſtles from the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo by the Son to God the Father, where it reſts.</p>
                  <p>Now to <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Their Proceeding is far different; they hear the whole Syſtem of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:106095:105"/>
                     <hi>Faith</hi> commended by the Church as revealed by God, and take it into Examination: And ſome things diſpleaſing them in it, they fall to reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and cut off at one Blow all things not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſy contained in <hi>Scripture:</hi> Here is one <hi>Choice.</hi> Then <hi>Scripture</hi> is called to the Bar, and near a third part of it condemned, and lopt off; which is a ſecond <hi>Choice.</hi> Thirdly, there being ſtill ſeveral things in the remnant, which diſpleaſe them, (as underſtood by the Church) they reject that Interpretation, and fix on it ſuch a one as pleaſes them moſt. So that even what Senſe they retain, they do it upon this their <hi>Haereſis,</hi> or <hi>Choice.</hi> What Evidence can convince a Man to be a <hi>Chooſer in Faith,</hi> that is, <hi>a Heretic,</hi> if <hi>theſe Men</hi> be not by this Proceeding ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſuch?</p>
                  <p>For a farther confirmation of this, conſider the ſeveral ways of Catholics and Proteſtants in entertaining Propoſitions of Faith. A Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic hearing from the Church our Saviour's Words with the Senſe; that is, the compleat <hi>Scripture,</hi> (for the bare Word without the Senſe, is no more <hi>Scripture,</hi> than a Body without a Soul, or Life, is a Man) preſently believes them, and what Reaſon ſoever may appear to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he ſilences it, and ſubmits his <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to <hi>Faith;</hi> and let the Words ſeem harſh, and the Senſe unconceivable, yet the Truth of God triumphs over all thoſe petty Oppoſitions. A Proteſtant hears the ſame, and preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults his Reaſon, and till he hath its Verdict,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:106095:105"/>ſuſpends his Judgment. If that ſay with the <hi>Phariſce,</hi> (Joh. 3.9.) <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> or with the <hi>Capharnaits,</hi> (Joh. 4.) <hi>This is a hard ſaying, who can hear it?</hi> the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately renounces it. So we ſubmit our Reaſon to Faith, you ſet yours above it; We frame our Reaſon according to the Dictamens of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, you ſhape Revelation by your Reaſon. In fine, you ſet your Reaſon on a Throne, to Judge of that Word by which one day you are to be Judged. You may as eaſily prove the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> and <hi>Capharnaits</hi> to be better Chriſtians than the Apoſtles, as that your Procedure in receiving Faith, is better than that of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church.</p>

                     <hi>CHarity,</hi> or the Love of God above all things, is much more eſteemed, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored amongſt us, than amongſt you.

That without it all other Vertues, <hi>gift of tongues, power of working miracles, knowledge of myſteries,</hi> nay even <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope, are nothing, avail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, are no more to be regarded than ſounding braſs, and a tinkling cymbal,</hi> &amp;c. (1 Cor. 13.)</p>
                  <p>In fine, althô, with Divines, we are perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that theſe two great Vertues may be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:106095:107"/>yet we hold their ſeparation to be their ruin; that as <hi>Charity</hi> is but ſuperficial, and not real, without the light of <hi>Faith;</hi> ſo <hi>Faith</hi> is cold without the warmth of <hi>Charity.</hi> He who knows God without loving him, is impious; and he who loves him without knowing him aright, is blind. A Believer without Love, is ungrateful; a Lover without Knowledge, is fenſleſs; ſo theſe two Vertues muſt aſſiſt one another. We muſt aim to have <hi>a living Faith, which works by Love,</hi> Gal. 5.6. and <hi>Love</hi> is the proper work of <hi>Faith. Opus fidei dilectio,</hi> Aug. tr. 10. in Epiſt.

                  <p>Thus we joyn together thoſe two great Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; this we believe, this we teach of <hi>Charity:</hi> whilſt you, out of an ill-grounded opinion of your <hi>Fac-totum-Faith</hi> (relying on it for <hi>Remiſſion of Sins, Juſtification, Perſeverance,</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi>) exhauſt your Rhetorick ſo much in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that your Darling, that you have no

                  </p>
                  <p>Our Practice as much ſurpaſſes yours, as to nouriſhing <hi>Charity,</hi> as our Doctrin doth: For, ſeeing the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and <hi>Love of our ſelves,</hi> are oppoſit, and the one withers as the other thrives, their practice muſt be moſt proper to nouriſh <hi>Charity,</hi> which aims moſt at mortifying <hi>Self-love;</hi> and on the contrary, thoſe who foſter <hi>Self-love,</hi> muſt annihilate <hi>Charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now what Practice can you ſhew for the mortification of the Body, the quelling our Paſſions, the renouncing of our Will? What Documents do you give for theſe? What Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples can you ſhew ſince your reformation of them? You have never been able to find in the three Kingdoms a dozen Perſons of either Sex, who for ſo many years would ſequeſter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Enjoyments of the World, to ſerve God in voluntary Poverty, Chaſtity, and Obedience. Whence comes this, but from <hi>Self-love,</hi> which abounds in them; and the lack of the <hi>Love of God,</hi> which might cement their Hearts together?</p>
                  <p>Whence comes that inſupportable Pride, which makes your Proſelytes ſo refractory to God, and his Vicars, their Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Superiors; That they are ſo tenacious of their extravagant Fancies, ſo ſtubborn in their uncouth Reſolutions, ſo intractable in their Manners, ſo humorſom in all their Actions and Converſations, but a latent Pride, the proper Offspring of <hi>Self-love,</hi> and the Bane of <hi>Charity?</hi>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:106095:108"/>Look into 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. you ſhall there find a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of <hi>Charity</hi> and its Qualities. <hi>Charity ſuffereth long, and is kind; Charity envieth not; Charity vaunteth not it ſelf, is not puffed up, doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly, ſeeketh not her own, is not eaſily provoked, thinketh no evil, rejoyceth not in iniquity, but rejoyceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all things.</hi> Should I now examin the Life of generally all who deliver themſelves to your Direction, upon theſe Heads, and ſhew how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of this appears in your Manners, and how much there is quite contrary to it: the Picture, if ſincere, would fright you, or confound you, how great ſoever your Confidence be.</p>
                  <p>In fine, the words of our Saviour to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> (Apoc. 3.17.) may be very well applied to you. <hi>Thou ſayeſt, I am rich, and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with goods, and have need of nothing; and knoweſt not that thou art wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</hi> God open the eyes of your Heart, to ſee this; that ſo you may be moved to ſeek for <hi>Gold tried,</hi> (Spiritual Riches) where it is to be found, in the true Church.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I know of no ſuch Doctrin of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Love due to God. I know that all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics applaud the Saying of S. <hi>Bernard, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus amandi Deum, eſt amare ſine modo.</hi> I know that Divines require as well as S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity in all Vertues except <hi>Charity;</hi> That all Vertues are betwixt two Vices, whereof one offends by exceeding, the other by not reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its due meaſure. And this they aſſure even of <hi>Hope,</hi> which is betwixt <hi>Preſumption</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair;</hi> and of <hi>Faith,</hi> which is betwixt a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart, believing all things; and a hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to believe any thing. Love cannot be too great, and ſo hath only one Vice contrary to it, by <hi>defect,</hi> loving too little. Is this Doctrin <hi>Impious?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence what you ſay, <hi>Some mincing it ſo, as if they were afraid of his being too much beloved.</hi> This I ſay is an Untruth; and I challenge you to produce your Authors, or to be held a Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niator.</p>
                  <p>G. B. ibid. <hi>Some blaſphemouſly teach, that we are not at all bound to love him.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is alſo untrue. All acknowledge a Precept to Love God; but this being a poſitive
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:106095:109"/>Precept, which obliges only for ſome determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate time, ſome Authors have enquired when that time is? And in reſolving this obſcure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decided Queſtion there have been ſome variety of Sentiments, without any difference as to the ſubſtance of the Precept. If God hath revealed to you a Deciſion of this intricate Queſtion, bleſs the World with that Information, and prove well what you ſay, and I aſſure you we will not blame you for it.</p>
                  <p>G. B. ibid. <hi>There is an Impiety in the Morals of ſome of that Church, particularly amongſt the Diſciples of</hi> Loyola, <hi>beyond whatever was taught amongſt the worſt of Heathen Philoſophers.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You are no competent Judge in matter of <hi>Piety,</hi> as being acquainted neither with the Practice, nor Theory of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. You are not ſufficiently informed of the Cauſe in which you preſume to Judge, having no knowledge at all of one ſide, and but a very ſuperficial knowledge of the other. By ſhooting your Bolt ſo lightly, you will eaſier convince the World that you are <hi>Inconſiderate</hi> and <hi>Raſh,</hi> than that thoſe you call the Diſciples of <hi>Loyola</hi> are <hi>Impious.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> Efficacy of Sacraments.</head>
               <p>G. B. p. 80. <hi>THE Doctrin of the Efficacy of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, for conveying of Grace by the work wrought, looks like a Deſign againſt all ſerious preparation for the worthy receiving of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Many alive ſtill remember, when the Godly could find out Plots, dangerous Plots, Popiſh Plots, in every innocent Recreation of the Perſons whom they miſliked. You imitate exactly thoſe Factious Sectaries, in fancying the like dangerous Contrivances. Is Attrition with the Sacrament ſaid to ſuffice for Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? It is on a Deſign to deſtroy Piety. Are Prayers ſaid in Latin? It is on a Deſign againſt Piety. Are probable Opinions allowed of? There lies a Deſign againſt Piety. Are we taught to do our Works with a good Intention? A Popiſh Deſign againſt Piety. Are Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments connected with Grace, and ſaid to be efficacious ſigns of it? It looks like a Deſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Piety. And whatſoever we do, theſe People ſuſpect a Deſign againſt Piety. As of the Jews <hi>Iſaias</hi> ſaid, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.12.) <hi>What the People ſpeaks of, is confederacy; Omnia quae loqnitur po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus iſte, conjuratio eſt.</hi> So much were they frighted then, with the apprehenſion of the Union betwixt the two Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:106095:110"/>and ſo ſtruck are you likewiſe with the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of <hi>Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Jews ſurmized a Confederacy out of a <hi>real Fear;</hi> the Factious old Parliamentarians out of a <hi>pretended Fear.</hi> What moves you, a real, or only pretended <hi>Fear?</hi> Or do you ſpeak out of ignorance of our Tenets? Or ill will to our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? Either may eaſilier be ſuſpected, than any real fear or concern for Piety.</p>
               <p>We have been taught to acknowledge ſome vertue in the Sacrament of the new Law, (in vertue of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitution, and becauſe they are the Inſtruments to apply the Merits of his Paſſion to our Soul) which was not in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the old Law, nor in any Ceremony of Human Inſtitution; for S. <hi>Paul</hi> (Gal. 4.9.) calls the the Sacraments of the old Law, <hi>Weak and beggerly Elements,</hi> in compariſon doubtleſs of thoſe of the new. Theſe then are more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, ſtronger and richer. Yet the others could ſtir up the Receiver to an inward diſpoſition for Grace, nay a Ceremony of meer Human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution may have that force. Wherefore the Sacraments of the new Law muſt, <hi>by the work wrought,</hi> do more than to ſtir up the Receiver to good Works.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 81. <hi>By this Doctrin, be a Man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ill prepared, yet he is ſure of the Efficacy of the Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here you diſcover your wilful Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our Doctrin, that you might with ſome colour calumniato it. We unanimouſly teach.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:106095:111"/>that a bad Diſpoſition of the Receiver puts a ſtop, <hi>(ponit obicem)</hi> to the Effect of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is it ſelf a Sacrilege; and that the Sacrament ſo received unworthily, ſerves for the damnation of the Receiver, as thoſe who receive the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, <hi>receive Judgment againſt themſelves.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.29.</p>

               <p>G. B. pag. 82. <hi>Two general Doctrins they have, which at two ſtrokes diſſolve all the Bonds of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.

                  </gap> the ſame time take away his Judicial Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; to name him Judge Arbiter, and tie him to ſpeak only what you pleaſe? But I will leave him, and ſpeak to the thing.</p>
               <p>That you may conceive what are <hi>probable Opinions,</hi> you are to take notice, that <hi>Moral A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> may be reduced to four Claſſes: To ſuch as are <hi>evidently good, evidently bad, uncertain,</hi> and <hi>indifferent,</hi> according as they are related to the Law, (whether <hi>Divine, Ecclefiaſtical,</hi> or <hi>Civil</hi>) which is their proper Rule. Thoſe are <hi>evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good,</hi> which are conformable to the Law: As to <hi>Love God,</hi> or <hi>Deal with others as we would be dealt by.</hi> Thoſe are <hi>evidently bad,</hi> which are contrary to the Law: As to <hi>Blaſpheme God,</hi> or to <hi>Wrong our Neighbor.</hi> Thoſe are <hi>indifferent,</hi> which are neither commanded nor forbidden: As to waſh our Hands before Eating, uſed by the Phariſees, (<hi>Matt.</hi> 15.) Thoſe are <hi>uncertain,</hi> when a Law is known, but it is unknown whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it obliges in ſome Circumſtances. For Example: The reſiſting an Enemy that attacks you on the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> and repairing the Breaches which he makes. 1 <hi>Macch.</hi> 2.38.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt Claſs, Actions <hi>evidently good, Probability</hi> doth not look on them as its Object.</p>
               <p>The ſame for thoſe which are <hi>evidently bad:</hi> They can never be committed without offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God. If any hold the contrary, ſtone him; the Stones will not hit me, nor any <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> unleſs by ſuch an Accident as befel <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Lucian,</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:106095:113"/>when directing his Thunderbolt at a Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, he miſt him, and hit, and fired <hi>Pallas</hi> her Temple. And what you ſay of <hi>committing any Sin with directing Intention,</hi> is ſo great a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, that no <hi>good Intention</hi> of <hi>oppoſing Popery</hi> will excuſe it.</p>
               <p>The third Claſs, of Actions <hi>uncertain</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are properly the Object of <hi>probable Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;</hi> whilſt it is not certain whether the Law oblige, <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> or no, in theſe Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are not ſpecified in the Law, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very much the nature of the Action: There being no evident Principle to ſhew it to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or unlawful, the Judgment we frame of it, muſt be an <hi>Opinion</hi> only; and if the Reaſon be ſtrong, it is called a <hi>probable Opinion.</hi> For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; the Jews, (1 <hi>Macch.</hi> 2.40, 41.) hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that their Brethren had been aſſaulted on a Sabbath, and not reſiſting, for fear of breaking the Sabbath by working on it, were all killed, reſolved notwithſtanding that Command, to make what reſiſtance they could on that Day. Which Reſolution was grounded on a <hi>probable Opinion:</hi> for on the one ſide was the Letter of the Law prohibiting all Labor on that Day: then, they might think God would protect them, whilſt they kept his Law, as he conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Goods, whilſt they went thrice a year to the Temple, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 34.24.) and if he did not pleaſe to defend them miraculouſly, they might think it was his will, that they ſhould glorifie him by giving their Lives, rather than
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:106095:113"/>break his Commandment; which Perſuaſion poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the greateſt part of Chriſtians near the Apoſtles Times, as may be ſeen in <hi>Tertull. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logetick.</hi> On the other ſide, they conſidered the Law of Nature obliging to ſeek Self-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that to expect a Miracle, was to tempt God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence they concluded, that it was lawful to labor for <hi>Self-defence</hi> even on the Sabboth.</p>
               <p>To make an Opinion <hi>probable, Suarez</hi> (<hi>Diſ.</hi> 12. <hi>de bonit. &amp; malit.</hi>) requires that it be neither contrary to the Senſe of the Church, nor to any Opinions commonly received, and that it be grounded on Authority and Reaſon great above exception. All Divines, even the largeſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a <hi>weighty Motive,</hi> a <hi>ſtrong Reaſon,</hi> and that even comparing it with the contrary Motives; otherwiſe they agree, that the Opinion will not be <hi>probable,</hi> but <hi>dangerous, raſh,</hi> and <hi>improbable.</hi> See two large Treatiſes compoſed by <hi>R. F. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony Teril,</hi> (a great Ornament of the Society, and an Honor to our Nation) in defence of this <hi>Rule of Conſcience.</hi> You will find in him a ſolid Diſcourſe, well grounded, and gravely handled, as Truth ſhould be delivered, without any of that <hi>Buffoonry</hi> which accompanies ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of theſe Times, which may be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in a <hi>Comedy,</hi> but not in a Treatiſe of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, I think, cannot be doubted of in <hi>Theſi,</hi> or in general. I will not deny, but in <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſi,</hi> in particular Doubts or Queſtions, ſome
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:106095:114"/>Men have not ſtuck ſo cloſe to the Letter of the Law as they ſhould, as <hi>Fr. Teril</hi> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore. But thoſe Mens Aſſertions do not take away what we have ſaid: for their private Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, not well grounded, deſerve not the name of <hi>probable Opinions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt Claſs of Actions, are thoſe called <hi>indifferent,</hi> as not being mentioned in any Law. Theſe muſt draw all the Morality they have <hi>Ex intentione, ſive voluntate operantis.</hi> In thoſe a good intention of the Man who produces them, or his will to do them for the love of God, gives them a good Morality, which of themſelves they have not; as on the contrary, a bad Intention gives them the nature of Sin.</p>
               <p>Hence what you ſay, that our Doctrin is, <hi>Any Sin may be committed innocently, by directing our Intention,</hi> is a great <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruth,</hi> and as great a <hi>Calumny.</hi> No Intention can juſtifie a bad Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but a bad Intention may vitiate the beſt Action: As to give an Alms for vanity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Bonum ex integrâ cauſâ, malum ex quocunque de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectu,</hi> is a Maxim never more true, than in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Actions. We are taught in the Catholic Church, not only to do good things, but to do them well; not only to do juſt things, but to do them juſtly; nor pious things, but piouſly, <hi>non tantum bona, juſta, pia; verum etiam benè, juſtè, piè.</hi> Nay, a pious modern Author ſays, that God regards more the <hi>Adverbs,</hi> than the <hi>Nouns,</hi> or <hi>Verbs.</hi> For Example; A Judge hears atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively a Cauſe pleaded before him in order to
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:106095:114"/>give Sentence, <hi>ſecundùm allegata &amp; probata:</hi> the Action it ſelf is good, yet his Intention may mend or mar it. Doth he that, for his lawful allowance, it is of ſmall merit. Regards he his Duty to his Prince and Country, it is better; If for God, it is beſt of all. But doth he intend by it to pleaſure a Friend, or practiſe Revenge on an Enemy, althô his Sentence be juſt, yet he is unjuſt in pronouncing it, to ſatisfie his own Paſſions of <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Hatred.</hi> This is our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, this we teach, this we practiſe, which you underſtand not; and your perpetual fault is, <hi>to ſpeak evil of things which you know not,</hi> (Jude Ver. 10.) If you deſire farther information of our Doctrin in this Point, ſee S. <hi>Fran. de Sales lib.</hi> 11. <hi>de Amore Dei cap.</hi> 13.</p>

And why may not this Power be acknowledged in the Pope as well as in others?</p>
               <p>But is the diſpenſing with Oaths a Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of God? Sure it is not, ſeeing God, who declared their force,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Exod. <hi>20.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What you charge on us here <hi>(not keeping the Sabbath)</hi> was charged on our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and his Apoſtles by the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, and is reproached to <hi>Proteſtants</hi> by the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans.</hi> I do not deny, but many are defective in this Obſervance, and that as other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, ſo this hath ſuffered; yet I think I could as eaſily find Inſtances for the very things you
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:106095:116"/>reproach to us, amongſt you, as you amongſt us. I will not excuſe all that is done amongſt Catholics, and believe you would find it hard enough to juſtifie all that is done by your: Yet I will tell you, that unleſs you will condemn Chriſt and his Diſciples, and juſtifie the Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Scribes and Phariſees, againſt them, you muſt acknowledge that there is a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſs</hi> of Duty not intended by Almighty God. And it is very remarkable, that ſeveral Accuſations of the Breach of the Sabbath having been brought to our Saviour by the Scribes and Phariſees, Chriſt always bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their blind indiſcreet Zeal, and retorted the Accuſations, alledging ſeveral of their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms undefenſible, but never ſeconded the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation; quite contrary, either confounded the Accuſers, by minding them of their own Faults, or excuſed the Fact from Guilt. Which is a ſufficient Proof, that the Law of God doth not require that ſuperſtitious Obſervance which the Scribes, the <hi>Puritans,</hi> and you require; for want of which you blame us, and are your ſelf blamed by others.</p>
               <p>Yet I will not excuſe all that is done by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics in this matter, which cannot be charged on the Church, becauſe ſhe condemns and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures it.</p>
               <p>I muſt take notice here of a Craft you uſe in this place, to mingle true and falſe things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For Example, pag. 85. <hi>That Children may lawfully intend killing their Parents,</hi> is falſe; <hi>That
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:106095:116"/>they may Marry without their Conſent,</hi> is doubted by none, I think, as to the validity of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, unleſs there be ſome Municipal Laws pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding againſt it. <hi>Item</hi> pag. 86. <hi>They bar the Clergy the uſe of Marriage,</hi> is true; <hi>That they allow Concubinage,</hi> is falſe. By which petty Art you ſurpriſe your Reader, and puzzle one who undertakes an Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Were I minded to imitate you, in giving a proſpect of your Garden, and that without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending <hi>Truth,</hi> as you have done, I could ſhew Matter enough for your Confuſion, or for your Zeal, if it be real. I never was within it, I thank God; and the greateſt part of my Life I have paſt at a diſtance almoſt out of ſight of it; yet Fame hath brought enough to make a woful deſcription of it. It is not needful to <hi>pierce your walls to diſcover wicked abominations,</hi> (<hi>Ezech.</hi> 8.8, 9.) only looking over them with a Perſpective Glaſs, a Man may diſcover <hi>Weeds,</hi> and <hi>Thorns,</hi> and <hi>Cockle,</hi> and what not?

A ſecret malignity in Nature prompts ſome to

You follow the eaſier courſe, and the moſt taking with Men, whom you affect to pleaſe.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXVI.</hi> Riches, and Pride of Churchmen.</head>
               <p>FROM pag. 91. till 100. we have a long enumeration of the Riches and Pride, and Ambition of Popes, Cardinals, Biſhops, Abbots, and all Churchmen, You blame the ſumptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Church Ornaments, the Solemnity of our Proceſſions, the Majeſty of our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which things being not of Faith, I think my ſelf not obliged to Anſwer farther, than by ſhewing a good uſe may be made of them.</p>
               <p>I grant that Chriſt founded his Church in real Poverty; he ſent his Apoſtles (<hi>Luc.</hi> 10.8.) to Preach, with order to live upon what they found in the Places whither they went, and be content with what was given them. He gave them a Right to a Subſiſtence, declaring, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 10.10.) that <hi>a Workman deſerves his Diet.</hi> And that <hi>he who ſerves the Altar, ought to live of it.</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13.) And althô S. <hi>Paul</hi> was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to make uſe of this Right commonly, for a very good Reaſon; yet the reſt did, and he might lawfully have done every where, and actually did it at <hi>Philippi,</hi> (Phil. 4.15.) Yet I do not find that ever our B. Saviour ſtinted the Apoſtles, ſo as if any thing were freely given, beyond what was meerly neceſſary, they ſhould be obliged to refuſe it, or reſtore the overplus
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:106095:118"/>to the Donors. Neither do I find your Brethren in the Miniſtry, commend very much your firſt Reformers for retrenching ſome of your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Lands, althô they left enough for not only a <hi>competent,</hi> but a <hi>noble Subſiſtence:</hi> nay, your modern Writers, <hi>W. L.</hi> and <hi>Heylin,</hi> accuſe them of Sacrilege. And I do not hear that your other Biſhops do break their Shins with haſte, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the ſurplus of their Revenues to the Heirs of the Donors, which they were bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore, if it were not lawful for Churchmen to enjoy more than what is neceſſary. Since the fall of Religion, indeed the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church hath not much encreaſed her Revenues; which rather proceeds from lack of Charity in your Laity, who give you nothing, (or becauſe the Wife and Children ſweep away what remains by each Incumbent at his Death) than to your love of Poverty, for which Vertue you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed it, when offered. I have heard at leaſt of none who would refuſe a Mannor, (or other conſiderable Boon) when freely given; and the hard uſage, which ſome of your Tenants com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of, from their Eccleſiaſtical Landlords, proves ſufficiently, that you are not inſenſible to the Allurements of the attractive Metal.</p>
               <p>Were Churchmen ſuch as they ought to be, the Laity would have little reaſon to repine at their Riches, althô much greater than they are. If they were Treaſurers of the Poor, Fathers to the Orphans, Helps to Widows, Hoſts to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Protectors to the Oppreſſed, and common
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:106095:118"/>Sanctuaries to all neceſſitous Perſons, ſuch as ſome are in the Catholic Church, whom I know, and many of whom we read. To ſuch as theſe Riches are no hindrance to their Function; they give them only occaſion of doing much good, and practiſing their Charity. If you think this to be blame-worthy, althô Riches be ſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, prove what you ſay out of Scripture, and excuſe your own Biſhops from that Crime, <hi>&amp; eris mihi magnus Apollo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Voluntary real Poverty</hi> is much commended in the Goſpel, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 19.21.) and we have thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands in our Church who profeſs it, and live in it; and you could never get ten of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to embrace it. There is another <hi>Poverty</hi> called <hi>of Spirit,</hi> commended (<hi>Mat.</hi> 5.3.) nay and commanded in Scripture, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 19.24.) and how great ſoever a ſtranger you are to Spiritual things, yet you will not ſay that this Poverty of Heart is inconſiſtent with effectual Riches; otherwiſe it would be impoſſible for a rich Man to be ſaved. A Man may be a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and yet be far from that <hi>Poverty of Spirit</hi> which gives a right to the Kingdom of Heaven, becauſe his Heart is fixed upon things he hath not. And on the contrary, another Man may be Maſter of a great part of the World, and yet have his Heart as free from it, as if he was not in the World; and to uſe the Apoſtles Phraſe, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31.) <hi>uſe the World as thô he uſed it not.</hi> Of this ſort of poor of ſpirit there are many in the Church, and always have been.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:106095:119"/>Hear S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> lib. de moribus Eccleſiae cap. 35. <hi>Sunt in Eccleſiâ Catholicâ innumerabiles fideles, qui hoc mundo non utuntur; ſunt qui utuntur, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam non utentes. There are innumerable Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Church, who make no uſe of the World; there are others, who uſe it as if they uſed it not.</hi> What hath the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church to ſay here?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> are perſonal Vices, ſo belong not to this Treatiſe: Yet I will ſay, that there have been both ancient and modern Popes, who have given greater Examples of Humility, than any your Church can ſhew, and who have made appear, that their Title, <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Servants of God,</hi> is no Complement. <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. would not own his Mother, when ſhe was brought to him in rich Clothes, ſaying, <hi>His Mother was a poor Woman, who never wore Silks in her life, ſhe was a Shepherds Wife.</hi> The next day ſhe being brought to him in Rags, he preſently acknowledged her. Some of them have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted the Privileges of their Chair, againſt ſuch as intrenched on their Rights; which may be done without any Pride at all, ſeeing they require it as due, not to their own Perſons, but to their Chair, to its Founders, S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and to his Superior, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> I never heard S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> ſuſpected of Pride, for refuſing to admit <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Great into the Church, before his Penance for the Slaughter at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> or for excluding him the Cancels after it: It was a Zeal of the Glory of God, and the good of the Church, which moved him; the Emperor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf underſtood it ſo.</p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:106095:119"/>
               <p>As for precious Ornaments of the Church, I will own ours to be too coſtly, when you ſhall have proved, that any thing is too good for God's Service; not till then. The infinit Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God is ground ſufficient to oblige us to bear him the greateſt Reſpect interiorly, and expreſs our Duty to our Creator, and our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to ſo great a Benefactor, by returning to him in the beſt manner we can, an Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of his moſt bountiful Gifts. This ſerves alſo to ſtir up in the Auditory Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Reſpect and Adoration, which otherwiſe would fail.</p>

               <p>G. B. pag. 108. Grotius <hi>ſays, that in</hi> Charles <hi>the Fifth's time, more than One hundred thouſand, were butchered on the accout of Religion. And in his Son</hi> Philip<hi>'s time the Duke d'Alva did in a ſhort time cut down Thirty ſix thouſand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Grotius</hi> was an eminent Man for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things, but not renowned for his Skill in <hi>Arithmetick:</hi> I have heard from one well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, that he could not count Ten; that he knew not the ordinary currant Mony of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:106095:122"/>his Country; that when he eſcaped out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he had like to have been diſcovered by a Ferry-man by that ignorance; he was ſo noted for it. So I ſhould not wonder that he were miſtaken in his Calculation of ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands. Secondly, It is probable he reckons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the number of thoſe butchered, ſuch as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the Boors War in <hi>Germany,</hi> and Wars of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> whoſe Death muſt be put to the Account of their <hi>Rebellion,</hi> not to that of <hi>Religion.</hi> Thirdly, he writ in favor, and defence of the <hi>States</hi> Cauſe; to whoſe vindication it was neceſſary, that the Motives of their taking Arms againſt their Sovereign ſhould be aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to the utmoſt. We all remember the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Inſcription put over the Niche where the Statue of the late King of Happy Memory ſtood. All the World knows, that without any diſparagement to the reſt, There never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had been a King, who leſs deſerved ſuch a Title; yet no doubt, had that uſurped Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment continued, Stories would have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented to prove it, and thoſe concerned in the <hi>Rebellion</hi> would have believed them, as you do <hi>Grotius.</hi> Laſtly, Suppoſe all <hi>Grotius</hi> ſays true, it follows only, that it was the Misfortune of thoſe great Princes to have many Offenders in that kind in their time, provoke the Sword of Juſtice. As if in <hi>England</hi> a Spirit of Thieving ſhould ſpread it ſelf amongſt the People, for which in the time of the beſt of Kings many ſuffer, yet without reflecting on the Honor of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:106095:122"/>the King, or Equity of the Laws. Theſe are not <hi>Crimes</hi> of the Government, but <hi>Misfortunes,</hi> for which Princes are to be pitied, not repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with them.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You cannot diſcover better who is your Maſter, and what a Proficient you are in his School, than by venting ſuch palpable Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths. Cardinal <hi>Barbarin,</hi> Dean of the Sacred Colledge, hath been known to accompany ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times Malefactors to the Gallows, heard their Confeſſions, moved them to a deteſtation of the Sins which brought them to that Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:106095:123"/>raiſed them up to hopes of pardon thrô the Merits of our Bleſſed Saviour, and comfort them with hopes of a happy Life, after that tragical end of this. I name him in particular, becauſe he is known to many of our Nation, who have and do acknowledge his Civility to them, althô of a different Perſuaſion. In time of the great Plague, under <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. he viſited in Perſon Places Infected, enquired after the Wants, informed of the Diligence of the Officers appointed for the Relief of the Sick, and provided according as Occaſions required both for Soul and Body. <hi>S. Charles Borromeus,</hi> a Cardinal and Archbiſhop, gave ſo great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Paſtoral Vigilancy, and Apoſtolical Zeal, that none of our Reformed Prelates ever will imitate them. Your Confidence is admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in relating ſuch evident Untruths, which all who have ſeen <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Flanders</hi> can contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. Enquire of the Life of the preſent Lord Biſhop of <hi>Gant,</hi> of ſeveral in <hi>France,</hi> and if you have one ounce of good Blood in your Body, ſome of it will appear on your Face.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 112. <hi>I deny not, but even theſe laſt Ages have produced great Men amongſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who ſeem to have deſigned the reviving of the ancient Diſcipline, both among the Clergy and the People. But as theſe Inſtances are rare, ſo they were hated and perſecuted, witneſs</hi> Arnaud<hi>'s Book of the frequent Communion,</hi> Janſenius <hi>and</hi> S. Cyran.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is no Pretence more dangerous, or even fatal, both to Church and State, than
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:106095:123"/>that of <hi>Reforming Abuſes,</hi> and <hi>Reviving antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Laws,</hi> which ſerves every <hi>Pragmatical Head,</hi> aſſoon as he hath read the ancient Statutes or Canons (thô he underſtands the Senſe of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) to detract from the preſent Government, and (if by meeting others as raſh as himſelf, he is enabled for ſuch a Work) to endeavor the change of it, under the ſpecious Pretext of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi> You muſt own the truth of this, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you will juſtifie the late <hi>Rebellion</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> which was begun, carried on, and finiſhed, under that Colour.</p>
               <p>The Opinions Men are as different as their Faces, ſcarce ever two alike: Education, Diet, Company, Friends, Buſineſs, and other extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick Occaſions, alter our Judgment of things: many more have influence on our Judgment of Governments; but moſt of all, Love and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred have an imperceptible, yet unreſiſtible force over our Underſtanding: ſo that one and the ſame Action will to one ſeem to deſerve a <hi>Panegyrick,</hi> which to another ſhall be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a <hi>Satyr,</hi> meerly becauſe they are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly affected to the Perſon who acts. Some, in fine, are ſo wayward, humorſom and peeviſh, as to be diſpleaſed with whatever is done by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; who can agree with no body, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every body gives, but becauſe they take from every body, occaſions of offences.</p>
               <p>It is a great error, to think that every one who blames another, hath reaſon for it. No Man ever was ſo holy, ſo perſect, ſo wiſe, as to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:106095:124"/>ſatisfie every body, and find no <hi>Momus</hi> who bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him. S. <hi>Paul</hi> was held a Blaſphemer and an Enemy, not only to the <hi>Epheſian Diana,</hi> Act. 9. but alſo to the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Act. 24. What leſs guilty than the Apoſtles? yet ſome <hi>thought to do God good ſervice in killing them.</hi> Joh. 16.2. What more innocent, than <hi>Jeſus</hi> newly born? yet he was forced to a Flight to ſave his Life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.13. What leſs repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible than his Doctrin, his Manners, his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, his Perſon? yet his Doctrin hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of Blaſphemy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.65. his Manners of Gluttony, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.19. his Miracles of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, <hi>Luc.</hi> 11.15. and his Perſon of being beſide himſelf, <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.31. None ever had a Miſſion from Heaven with more convincing Proofs of Miracles, than <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt;</hi> yet both had their Schiſmaticks: <hi>Moſes</hi> not only <hi>Core</hi> and his Fellows, but alſo <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Mary;</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> had the <hi>Capharnaits, Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> and one of his Apoſtles. And if we do not ſhut our Ears, we ſhall hear God himſelf by hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Blaſphemies, cenſured for bad Governing the World, and even for not Creating it well; Man, by a preſumptuous Folly, preferring his own dim Lights before the <hi>inacceſſible Light</hi> of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. before whom even Man's <hi>greateſt wiſdom is folly.</hi> 1 Cor. 3.19.</p>
               <p>It is therefore a great folly for any one to hope to give ſatisfaction to all, or even to avoid Cenſure of ſome; that is a good Fortune not granted to Saints, Martyrs, Apoſtles, or even
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:106095:124"/>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, <hi>God bleſſed for ever more,</hi> Rom. 9.5 and with what probability can any Man hope for it? Our Endeavors muſt be, to give no ground for Detraction, and ſo to behave our ſelves, as nothing may be reproacht us with truth.</p>
               <p>Governments are more obnoxious to Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, as including greater variety of Actions and Deſigns, in which more Perſons are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned as acting in, or ſuffering by them. This makes a vaſt diverſity of Judgments in ſeveral Perſons, according as they fancy themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded or neglected, advanced or kept back, benefited or prejudiced by them; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they hope or fear from them. A private Man poſſeſſed with an opinion of his own Ability, (which no body ſees but himſelf, nor he neither, but thrô ſelf-love) ſhall think himſelf as fit to ſit at the Helm, as thoſe who do; and finding his Preferment not to anſwer the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he hath of his own Capacity, thinks himſelf wronged by thoſe who are advanced before him. To revenge this imaginary Wrong, he commits a real one, by blaſpheming higher and lower Powers, calumniating their Actions, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring their Commands, and judging their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Erecting within himſelf (thrô a crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Raſhneſs, and ridiculous Ambition) a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal over thoſe, to whom by Publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he is ſubject. This Man by ſome weaker than himſelf, ſhall be looked on as a wiſe Man, a Zealot of the Publick Good, and a <hi>good Patriot;</hi>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:106095:125"/>when in reality, not Prudence but Paſſion go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns his Tongue, which only vents ſome indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted Choler.</p>
               <p>I grant, that in all Governments there are ſome Inconveniences, which we may wiſh were corrected. The Paſſions of ſome, the Weakneſs of others, cauſe Diſorders, which may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but not prevented. Thoſe who Govern, are not always at their own diſpoſal; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to pleaſure their Friends, ſometimes to avoid diſpleaſing others, they are in a manner forced to ſome things, which were they left to themſelves they would not do. They muſt ſometimes give way to a leſſer Evil, to avoid a greater; in which they deſerve compaſſion, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than blame. Moreover, they are indeed greater than others, yet not Gods, but Men; not omniſcient, but ignorant of many things which paſs in their Government, and it may be are acted in their Name, and by their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, yet contrary to their Intentions, which are (ſuppoſed to be) always for the Publick Good. It may be they know the thing, and diſlike it; but know not how to remedy it, without ſome other Inconvenience; (the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding of all Faults, is reſerved for Heaven.) Amongſt Men, he is beſt, who hath feweſt Faults, not he who hath none, (ſuch an one is a <hi>Chymera</hi>) and ſmall ones may be connived at, in conſideration of great Vertues. Thus every private Man ought to ſuppoſe, that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magiſtrate either doth not know the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:106095:125"/>Faults of thoſe he Employs, or thinks them not conſiderable, or knows not how to remedy them, without incurring others as great or greater.</p>
               <p>What is the Duty then of a private Man, who ſees theſe Miſcarriages? 1. To pray God to mend all, or at leaſt to prevent bad Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. 2. If he have occaſion and abilities, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint thoſe who may redreſs things, with what he thinks amiſs, and ſuggeſt, if he can, a proper Remedy; yet to leave the applying that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to thoſe who are charged with the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Concern. 3. In caſe he be involved in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or private Sufferings, he ought to bear it patiently, and expect the turn of the Tide. 4. He may reform his own Life and Actions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſevereſt Laws of State, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Church, provided he become not by that troubleſom to his Neighbors, (over whom he hath no Authority) or dangerous to Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors (whoſe Authority over him is eſtabliſhed by God) or diſturb the publick Peace, which is to be preferred before all Advantages which can be hoped from thoſe petty <hi>Reformers,</hi> or their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations.</hi> 5. Having done that, he ought to content himſelf, and preſs his lawful Superiors no farther, aſſuring himſelf he hath fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with the utmoſt of his Duty, by acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Rulers with what he thinks is for the publick Good, and by correcting himſelf. And he may ſuppoſe, that if theſe do not follow his Advice, either they ſee the thing not feaſible, or
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:106095:126"/>foreſee other Inconveniences, or expect ſome fitter Conjuncture; whereas by farther urging he cannot but offend: For, to communicate his Diſlikes to others, to draw them firſt to joyn in <hi>Petitioning,</hi> with a ſeeming Submiſſion, then by a real <hi>Violence</hi> to force Superiors to what they pretend, to unſettle the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to aim at ſetting up a new one, under pretence of <hi>Reforming</hi> the old, is in the State <hi>Sedition,</hi> and in the Church <hi>Schiſm;</hi> as great Crimes againſt both as any, except <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Hereſie,</hi> to which they diſpoſe.</p>
               <p>So that this <hi>Reforming Humor</hi> in Particulars, is the Daughter of <hi>Pride,</hi> and Mother of <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Rebellion;</hi> which makes it be ſuſpected by all lawful Superiors, in all Eſtabliſhed Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, till they know all the Particulars of which it conſiſts. <hi>Abſalon</hi> alledged plauſible Reaſons for altering the Government of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 15. and <hi>Oza</hi> for upholding the Ark with his Hand, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 6. The firſt, that the State was abandoned, no body looking to the Adminiſtration of Juſtice. The ſecond, that the Ark was in danger of being overturned Both grievouſly offended, exceeding the Bounds aſſigned them by God, notwithſtanding their ſpecious Pretences.</p>
               <p>Now to the Subject of your Complaint. The <hi>Roman Catholic</hi> Church holding her Faith by Tradition of all Ages from the Apoſtles, and never admitting the leaſt alteration in it; from which ſhe is preſerved by the help of the Holy
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:106095:126"/>Ghoſt, promiſed to her by <hi>the Author and Finiſher of it,</hi> Heb. 12.2. In this ſhe knows there can be no occaſion for it by any Error. As to her Diſcipline, ſhe acknowledges ſome Alterations, and hath no difficulty to admit of a <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> provided things be done according to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. This appears firſt by her Councils, even that of <hi>Trent,</hi> and ſeveral celebrated in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> in this laſt Age. Secondly, by the Practice of ſeveral Prelates, S. <hi>Charles Borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> S. <hi>Francis de Sales</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and others elſewhere. Thirdly, by thoſe of a lower Rank, as of S. <hi>Philip Nerius,</hi> who eſtabliſhed the Congregation of the Oratory in <hi>Italy.</hi> Pere <hi>Berule,</hi> (afterwards Cardinal) who eſtabliſhed that in <hi>France.</hi> Pere <hi>Vincent de Paul,</hi> who found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Prieſts of the Miſſion: All Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Clergy living in common, under the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of their ſeveral Superiors. Laſtly, did you regard what they are, not what they are ſaid to be, and as much conſult the Rules and Lives of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in themſelves, as you do in the Writings of their profeſſed Enemies, (whoſe Teſtimony for that reaſon you ought to ſuſpect) you would be forced to own, that <hi>S. Ignatius de Loyola</hi> hath reformed the Clergy, eſtabliſhing a Congregation of Clergy-men, who live more conformably to the moſt ancient Canons, and the Eccleſiaſtics of the Primitive Church, than any your whole <hi>Reformation</hi> hath, or ſhall be ever able to ſhew. Which you would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, did you reflect, that the numerous and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:106095:127"/>bitter Enemies which they have had, never do alledge any thing againſt their <hi>Lives</hi> or <hi>Rules:</hi> which is a convincing Proof they are irreproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>Now a word to thoſe whom you commend, for endeavoring a Reformation of the <hi>R. C.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jean du Verger,</hi> Abbot of S. <hi>Cyran,</hi> was only a private Prieſt, not a Doctor of Divinity, nor recommended by any other Degree, which might diſtinguiſh him from the meaneſt; having no Juriſdiction even over the Abby of which he bore the Title. But his Perſonal Endowments, either to good or evil, were exceeding great: A Large and comprehenſive Fancy, a tenacious Memory, and a Judgment to uſe all his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeaſonably: Deep Melancholy, abounding with aduſt Choler, was his Temper. The firſt fitted him for the Labor of hard Studies, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond emboldned him to write whatſoever he fancied, without any regard to Perſons, how great ſoever. Thoſe who particularly knew him, ſay, that no Hiſtory ſhews a Man of a more intriguing Wit, and fitter to Head a Faction: For, uſing too much this Faculty, he was by the King's Authority caſt into Priſon, being accuſed by a Biſhop (whom he had before inveigled) who diſcovered his Deſigns thrô horror of them. Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu</hi> being ſolicited to releaſe him, by <hi>R. S.</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> anſwered, <hi>Your Lordſhip doth not know the Man you ſpeak for. Had our Fathers dealt ſo with</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, France <hi>had enjoyed Peace.</hi> Now I would
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:106095:127"/>know of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> whether it be tolerable for a private Man to Cabal in his own Church, to frame a Party in it beſides, and contrary to the Orders of its lawful Superiors, oppoſe all eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Order, to unſettle old Cuſtoms and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce new ones, to make way for a new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? If you approve this in S. <hi>Cyran,</hi> how can you blame it in your <hi>Phanatics?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antony Arnaud</hi> was once a Doctor of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of <hi>Paris,</hi> but was caſt out of it, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded by the other Doctors, for his odd Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents in matters of Grace, which he obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately defended, even after they were Cenſured by <hi>Rome, France,</hi> and his own Faculty. And why might not that Faculty retrench from its Body, Members who refuſe to ſubmit to the major part, as by the Law of Nature all are bound to do, where there appears no Sin? I know of no other Perſecution he ever endured. As to his Book of the <hi>Frequent Communion,</hi> it tended not to the reforming, but to the deſtroying the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Penance, as is ſeen by its effects, where it prevails. I will not ſay he deſigned ſo much, I leave Intentions to God, the <hi>Searcher of Hearts, Jerem.</hi> 17.10. Many times a Buck is ſhot at, and a Man is killed. However it was inexcuſable in him to endeavor to change the Cuſtoms and Laws eſtabliſhed by the Church, and in force. His Title of Doctor could entitle him only to explicate the Laws received, and conform to them, not to abrogate and reform them: for a Doctor, as ſuch, hath no Juriſdiction, without
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:106095:128"/>which no Laws can be made, or unmade. The leaſt Biſhop, nay the meaneſt Curate of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh hath greater Power as to Laws, than the greateſt Doctor, as ſuch; ſeeing thoſe have ſome Juriſdiction, and this hath none at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cornelius Janſenius</hi> was a Biſhop, ſo his Caſe is different from the reſt; for he had Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Yet why he ſhould be cited amongſt the Reformers, I know not: He hath written ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Works, <hi>Mars Gallicus,</hi> Annotations on the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> and the Goſpels, <hi>Alexipharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> and his <hi>Auguſtinus.</hi> His <hi>Mars Gallicus</hi> is an Invective againſt the <hi>French</hi> Deſigns. His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations, and <hi>Auguſtinus,</hi> do not touch the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline of the Church. He contradicts in them ſome Points of the Doctrin of the Church De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which drew the Cenſure of <hi>Rome</hi> on the later Work of his, yet without touching his Perſon, who by his <hi>Will</hi> ſubmitted his <hi>Auguſtinus</hi> to the Cenſure of <hi>Rome,</hi> in whoſe Communion he always lived, and did then die, as an obedient Son of it. To know the opinion he had of your Faction, read his <hi>Alexipharmacum,</hi> (which he writ againſt your Brethren at <hi>Boyſleduc</hi>) and you will ſee it. What reaſon have you to complain of Severity uſed towards him? I know of none; his Perſon was never touched by any Cenſure.</p>
               <p>As for the Diſciples of S. <hi>Cyran</hi> and <hi>Janſenius,</hi> I grant there is amongſt them a Spirit of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendantiſm; (and what Aſſembly of Men is entirely free from ſuch?) Yet you cannot glory
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:106095:128"/>in them, if what Mr. <hi>Brevint</hi> ſays in his Preface to <hi>Saul and Samuel at Endor,</hi> be true, that they are more dangerous to a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> than even <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> and therefore warns all <hi>to avoid their Company.</hi> So that even thoſe who diſlike ſomething in us, condemn you.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here are a company of hard words to fright your Reader from <hi>Rome,</hi> as Birds are frighted from Corn with a Rattle; and there is likewiſe more noiſe than ſubſtance in both.</p>
               <p>I have lived in the greateſt Catholic Princes Dominions, and never ſaw, nor heard of what you ſay is daily done. Our Canons require Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years for a Biſhop; few are made ſo young, moſt are promoted to that Dignity very ancient. Yet this Age being determined only by Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Law, I will not deny, but that on ſome extraordinary Motive ſome have been diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with. If you blame this, ſee how you will excuſe S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who made S. <hi>Timothy</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus</hi> in his Youth, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12.</p>
               <p>If you condemn <hi>Pluralities</hi> in our Church, how will you excuſe your own, in which they
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:106095:129"/>are practiſed? Muſt the <hi>Canon Law</hi> be a <hi>Cable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> to us, and a <hi>Cobweb</hi> to you? If you diſlike <hi>Pluralities,</hi> begin with reforming your own Brethren, his Majeſties Chaplains in Ordinary, who can find a Conſcience to keep two Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if they meet with a Prince who will beſtow them.</p>

                  </note> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demand, Whether it be not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for a Biſhop to be abſent from his Dioceſe in the Circumſtances following? 1. For the good of the Church, as in General or Particular Councils. 2. For the good of the Nation, as in our Parliaments. 3. For the good of their Dioceſes, as when <hi>Flavianus,</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> went to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to preſerve his Epiſcopal Seat from being ruined, by appeaſing <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Great, offended for the throwing down of his Statues. 4. For any other Reaſon ſo weighty, that evidently it may be equivalent to the good which his Reſidence might bring. No Papiſt thinks them lawful, but only on ſuch Occaſions: for as for ſuch who do abſent themſelves either for Ambition, or Envy, or Pleaſure, or Friendſhip, or any other unlawful Deſign; or for ſome good, but ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as not to countervail that of their Duty to their Flock, we no leſs blame them than you: our Canons for Reſidence are as ſevers as can be, and thoſe often executed with the utmoſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor. What do you more?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Commendams?</hi> offend you; that is, the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:106095:129"/>the Means of Abbeys to thoſe who are not Monks. Yet we give them only to Clergy, you to meer Laymen. Secondly, we give them only for their Lives, you give them to their Heirs, Executors, Adminiſtrators, and Aſſigns. Thirdly, we leave the Abby, and its legal Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, a competent Subſiſtence for the Monks; you turn them a begging, out of God's Bleſſing into the warm Sun. When you have proved, that it is more lawful for your Church to ſteal a Gooſe, than for ours to pluck a Quill, I ſhall believe your Procedure legal, and ours illegal.</p>
               <p>G. B. ibid. <hi>They ſtrugled hard againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Attempt of thoſe who labored to have had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence declared to be of Divine Right, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of</hi> Trent.</p>

               <p>G. B. p. 116. <hi>THE firſt Character of our Faith is, that it was delivered to the World by Men ſent of God, and Divinely Inſpired, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Miſſion by Miracles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> All <hi>Divine Faith</hi> is built on the Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of God; the Men who delivered it at firſt, were but the Organs by which God ſpake, and their <hi>Words</hi> were his <hi>Words. When you received the word of God</hi> (ſays S. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.15.) <hi>which when you received of us, you received it not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God.</hi> Hence thoſe Men frequently uſe that Phraſe, <hi>Haec dicit Dominus, Thus ſays the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Faith</hi> is no farther a Theological Vertue, than it relies ſolely, and only, on the Truth <hi>(Veracity)</hi> of God, as on its Formal Object; as
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:106095:132"/>with our Divines, and out of them, Dr. <hi>Pearſon,</hi> in his Learned Explication on the Creed teaches. And in this even thoſe Men <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inſpired, proceeded as we do, reſolving their <hi>Faith</hi> into the Veracity of God as well as we: for their <hi>Faith</hi> was <hi>univoca,</hi> of the ſame nature with ours, with this only difference, that the Formal Object was applied to them clearly, and to us only obſcurely. The aſſent to ſuch a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in Chriſt, was <hi>Science,</hi> or <hi>Viſion;</hi> not ſo in any others. He might ſay, <hi>Quod ſcimus lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quimur, &amp; quod vidimus teſtamur,</hi> Jo. 3.11. <hi>We know what we ſpeak, and we teſtifie what we have ſeen.</hi> The reſt muſt ſay, <hi>Credimus, propter quod &amp; loquimur,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.13. <hi>We believe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſpeak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this manner <hi>Faith</hi> was firſt ſpread in the World. I ſay the <hi>Catholic Faith,</hi> not your <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Faith;</hi> which as it contains your poſitive and negative Articles, (otherwiſe it is not <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi>) was never delivered by any Man Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely Inſpired, but invented by your firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, who (as I have ſaid Chap. 22. Sect. 1.) taking the whole Sum of <hi>Faith revealed,</hi> topt, and lopt off it as much as they pleaſed; and from them you have not the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but the <hi>Proteſtant Faith; Fides temporum, non Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorum; A Faith of the Times, not of the Goſpels,</hi> ſays <hi>Tertul.</hi> Were theſe the <hi>Men of God Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely Inſpired and aſſiſted by Miracles?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You know we hold this not to be true, we received all by the ſame Authority, from the ſame Hand.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 117. <hi>What Man ſent of God was the firſt Author of the Belief of the Corporeal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, of the Sacrifice of the Maſs, of the Pope's Supremacy, of Purgatory, of Indulgences, and of all thoſe innumerable Superſtitions, of which Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is abſolutely ſilent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt was a <hi>Man ſent of God,</hi> and he was the <hi>firſt Author of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>G. B. ibid. <hi>If theſe Doctrins were not the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of Revelations, we cannot be obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them as ſuch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Your former Legerdemain comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, another conviction of your diſingenuous Proceeding. This appears by theſe Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>If the Bible were not the Offspring of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, we ſhould not be bound to believe it. If Chriſt were not true God, we ſhould not be bound to adore him as ſuch.</hi> Could you with patience hear a Pagan with ſuch a Sleight undermine the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Bible,</hi> or the Honor due to <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Prove what you odiouſly ſuggeſt, that the things, you wrongfully call <hi>Superſtitions,</hi> are not revealed, and you will do ſomething to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But you are too cunning to attempt any ſuch Proof, which you know ſurpaſſes your Strength. And therefore you had rather ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than prove it, that being more proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to your <hi>Capacity</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>G. B. ibid. <hi>They vouch Scriptures for Proof to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:106095:133"/>ſome of theſe, but theſe are ſo far ſtretched, that their ſure Retreat is in the Sanctuary of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You ſpeak as Dogmatically, as if it were <hi>ex Tripode.</hi> Here is an Aſſertion without any Proof, and ſo is a convincing Proof, that you have none. <hi>Tradition</hi> is indeed <hi>our Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> to which you have no Claim. By it we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived 1. Scriptures, 2. The Senſe of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which is their Soul.</p>
               <p>Now when Scriptures are doubtful in any Point, or as you phraſe it, ſeem not to reach home without <hi>Stretching,</hi> can we have better aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of their true meaning, than by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, which is clearly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us in Scriptures themſelves. And in following her Senſe, we are certain we follow Scriptures: which is the Diſcourſe of S. <hi>Aug.</hi> lib. 1. contra Creſcon. cap. penult. <hi>Quamvis hujus rei de Scripturis Canonicis non proferatur exemplum, Scripturarum etiam in hac re à nobis tenetur veritas, cum hoc facimus, quod univerſa jam placuit Eccleſiae, quam ipſarum Scripturarum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendat auctoritas, ut quoniam Sacra Scriptura fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere non poteſt, quiſquis falli metuit hujus obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate quaeſtionis, Eccleſiam de illâ conſulat, quam ſine ullâ ambiguitate Sancta Scriptura demonſtrat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>G. B. ibid. <hi>Till it be proved, that an Error could not creep into the World that way, we muſt be excuſed from Believing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Unleſs you prove, that Errors have crept in that way, you are inexcuſable. You
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:106095:133"/>actually rejected thoſe things as Errors, which were in poſſeſſion all over the World: unleſs you prove them to be ſuch, your Fact is cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal.</p>
               <p>G. B. ibid. <hi>It is not poſſible to know what Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions came from the Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Habemus hic confitentem reum.</hi> For if it be impoſſible to know what <hi>Traditions</hi> were Apoſtolical, your Reformers Act, in rejecting ſo many, was raſh and inconſiderate: They had been better adviſed to retain all, as they found them in the Church, than to cut them off. But your Procedure is as different in this, as in the reſt, from S. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> For was any thing doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, this Saint's Method was to conſult the Church, and adhere to what ſhe believed, or practiſed; (as you ſee in his Diſcourſe above) you conſult the Church too, but it is only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject her Practice, and condemn her Sentiments.</p>
               <p>The weight of the Authority of the Church may be ſufficient to convince, which are <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Traditions,</hi> as it convinces which are <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Writings.</hi> Yet we have other Signs: I will inſtance in two, one taken from S. <hi>Aug.</hi> l. 4. de Bapt. cont. Donat. c. 24. <hi>Quod univerſa tenet Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia, neec à Conciliis inſtitutum, ſed ſemper reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt, non niſi Apoſtolicâ traditum auctoritate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſſimè creditur. We ought to believe thoſe things to have come from the Apoſtles, which the whole Church holds, and were not introduced by Councils, but were always in uſe.</hi> To prove this, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that the firſt Perſons who mention them,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:106095:134"/>ſpeak of them, not as of things newly begun, but which were of ancient Practice.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Rule is taken out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> l. de Praeſcript. c. 28. <hi>Age nunc, omnes errave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint, deceptus ſit &amp; Apoſtolus de teſtimonio redden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do quibuſdam, nullam reſpexerit Spiritus Sanctus, uti eam in veritatem induceret, ad hoc miſſus eſt à Chriſto, ad hoc poſtulatus de Patre, ut eſſet Doctor veritatis, neglexerit officium Dei villicus, Chriſti vicarius, ſinens Eccleſias aliter in terris intelligere, aliter credere, quàm ipſe per Apoſtolos praedicabat. Ecquid veriſimile eſt, ut tot, ac tantae Eccleſiae in unam fidem erraverint? Nullus inter multos eventus eſt unus exitus, variaſſe debuerat error doctrinae Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiarum. Caeterùm quod apud multos unum inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitur non eſt erratum, ſed traditum.</hi> 
                  <q>Suppoſe, <hi>ſays he,</hi> that all Churches have erred, that the Apoſtle was deceived in the Teſtimony he gave to ſome, the Holy Ghoſt looked to none, to lead it into Truth, to which intent he was ſent by the Son, and demanded of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be the Doctor of Truth; Let the Steward of God, the Vicar of Chriſt, neglect his Duty, and permit the Churches to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and believe otherwiſe, than he had taught by his Apoſtles; Is it probable, that all Churches ſhould by Error fall into one and the ſame Opinion? When there are ſo many By-ways, thoſe who loſe the High-way would ſcarce wander into the ſame Error. So that certainly what is found one, and the ſame, in many Churches, is no Error newly
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:106095:134"/>invented, but it is Faith of old delivered.</q> Thus <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Anſwer you to his Diſcourſe, if you can.</p>
               <p>G.

I have read Mr. <hi>Claud</hi>'s Works, and was far from finding ſo much Satisfaction, as you promiſe your Reader, I believe rather upon Hear-ſay, than on your own Experience: Nay, I have from one of the eminenteſt Wits of the French <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genots,</hi> that <hi>Claud</hi> was not much eſteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his own for thoſe Works, which would have been neglected, had not <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Enemies commended them. You ſay <hi>Claud Baffled him;</hi> others are of a different opinion. I confeſs Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> thô very Learned, yet ſeemed not
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:106095:135"/>qualified to manage a Controverſie in defence of <hi>Church-Authority</hi> and <hi>Tradition,</hi> having (as much as lay in him) weakned both, by his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and Practice, during the time he ſtood out againſt the <hi>Cenſure</hi> and the <hi>Formula:</hi> which gave ſuch advantage to Mr. <hi>Claud,</hi> who indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly gathered together, and cunningly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned upon him his own Arguments, that ſome thought he had foiled his Adverſary; yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice to the <hi>Catholic Cauſe,</hi> which is not concerned in Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Perſonal Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>Let us now hear what you can alledge againſt the Authority of <hi>Tradition,</hi> to prove a <hi>Change unobſerved in our Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 121. <hi>We know the Chalice was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the People</hi> 250 <hi>Years ago.</hi>

This is an Argument that Changes cannot happen, without ſome notice ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of them; as in this, We know when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, (with the <hi>Schools</hi>) who oppoſed it, (the <hi>Huſſits</hi>) what Council commended it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned its Oppoſers, that of <hi>Conſtance.</hi> Which confirms our Rule, That when none of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, there hath been no Change.</p>
               <p>G. B. ibid. <hi>All once Worſhipped in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tongue, but after (by the overthrow of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire)

               <p>G. B. p. 123. <hi>THE Papiſt Church pretends to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations for ſome of her moſt doubtful Opinions; which are the Viſions and extraordinary Inſpirations of ſome of their Saints, from which they vouch a Divine Confirmation to their Doctrin.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you know of any Decree made in matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> upon a private <hi>Revelation,</hi> ſhew it. Till you do ſo, I will not believe it. S. <hi>Tho.</hi> 1. <hi>p. q.</hi> 1. <hi>a.</hi> 8. <hi>ad.</hi> 2. abſolutely excludes all private Revelations from grounding <hi>Faith.

                  <q>Our Faith relies on Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made to the Apoſtles, and Prophets; and not on ſuch as are made to other Doctors.</q>
               </p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 124. <hi>S.</hi> Paul <hi>being put to glory of Viſions and Revelationt, was to run back fourteen Years for one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, that he had fourteen Years before that great <hi>Revelation;</hi> but he never ſaid he had no others, either before, or after. And that <hi>Revelations</hi> were not ſo extraordinary in his Days, as you think, not only amongſt the Apoſtles, but even amongſt ordinary Chriſtians, you may learn out of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.30, 32. <hi>If any thing be revealed to another that ſitteth by, let the firſt hold his peace, for you may all Propheſie
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:106095:136"/>one by one, that you may all learn, and all be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted. And the Spirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets.</hi> And can you think the Apoſtle ſhould have no <hi>Revelation</hi> for ſo many years, when the meaneſt Chriſtians had them, even in the middle of their publick Aſſemblies, where they met with ſo many Diſtractions? What will you ſay to excuſe your Ignorance, if other <hi>Revelations</hi> made to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> be recorded in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? Now ſo it is: For, 1. A <hi>Macedonian</hi> (<hi>Act.</hi> 16.9.) appeared to him. 2. Our Lord ſpoke to <hi>Paul</hi> in a Viſion, (<hi>Act.</hi> 18.9.) Nay, the very place you cite to prove your Error, confutes it: for he ſays, <hi>Leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure through the abundance of Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there was given.</hi> 1 Cor. 12.7. He had then <hi>REVELATIONS,</hi> nay, <hi>abundance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations.</hi> See how careleſly you read, how ill you underſtand, and how negligently you write out of <hi>Scriptures!</hi> for you are certainly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that when S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke of that one, he did it, not becauſe he had been favored with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but becauſe that was a ſingular favor, and as ſuch eſteemed. But I diſpute ſeriouſly againſt a Man, who regards not what he writes.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 124. <hi>Are they not credible Stories, of Chriſt's appearing to ſome of their She Saints, and kiſſing them, being married to them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I doubt not but you, and your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, think this <hi>Folly.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays as much of ſuch as you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Animalis homo non per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipit ea, quae ſunt ſpiritus Dei; ſtultitia eſt enim illi,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:106095:137"/>&amp; non poteſt intelligere, quia ſpiritualiter examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> Of ſuch, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſters, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, who are by him declared incapable to judge, yet will be ſtill judging of the ſecret work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Holy Ghoſt in thoſe Souls, which he makes his Temples, in whom he lives, and they in him: which things ſeem <hi>folly</hi> to you, becauſe you have no experience of them, and probably never made an hour of <hi>Mental Prayer</hi> in all your Life, nor know how to make it. Hence <hi>you ſpeak evil of things you know not,</hi> Jude v. 10. It would be more to your Credit to omit thoſe things, than by ſpeaking of them, diſcover ſo ſhameful an Ignorance. The beſt Advice I can give you, is that of <hi>Job</hi> to his Friends, <hi>To be ſilent, that you may ſeem wiſe,</hi> Job 13.5.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt <hi>kiſſed them, and married them.</hi> This ſcandalizes your chaſt Brethren, who cannot hear of <hi>Marriage!</hi> and Mr. <hi>Brevint</hi> ſurmiſed God knows what <hi>unclean Spirits.</hi> I cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Conſcience and Experience of any of the whole Miniſtry, for the reality of what you deride; for I think there never was granted to any of you ſuch Favors. Yet to free you from fear of Illuſions (in thoſe Viſits) from bad Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, know, (and I wonder any one, who reads the Scripture, can be ignorant of it) that there is a Spiritual <hi>Contract</hi> betwixt Chriſt and the Church; <hi>Item,</hi> betwixt him and every pious
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:106095:137"/>Soul; That this <hi>Contract</hi> is called a <hi>Marriage;</hi> That on this ſcore the Sins of ſuch Souls againſt their Spouſe are called <hi>Adulteries,</hi> and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Adultereſſes.</hi> If you have any Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, theſe Hints will bring to mind a number of Texts of Scripture, which deliver what you ſcoff at. The whole Book of <hi>Canticles</hi> (or <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Song</hi>) celebrates that adorable <hi>Nuptial So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity.</hi> The very firſt words of it are, <hi>Oſcule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur me oſculo oris ſui,</hi> Cant. 1.1. <hi>Let him</hi> (or may he) <hi>kiſs me with a kiſs of his mouth.</hi> The Church, and every pious Soul, demanding as a ſingular Favor of her Spouſe that Bleſſing; which when granted to ſome, ſcandalizes you, modeſt Man, ſo different are your Sentiments in Spiritual things, from thoſe of the Holy Ghoſt, who ſays, (<hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3.) that the Soul ſhould <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that favor,</hi> ſhe at firſt demanded, and <hi>yet not be deſpiſed.</hi> You deſpiſe them all as <hi>Forgeries, Dreams, Effects of Melancholy, or Hyſterical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.</hi> What is Blaſphemy, if this be not? <hi>Our Lord for give you, for you know not what you ſay.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We build not our Faith on any of theſe <hi>Revelations</hi> you ſpeak of; ſo this Hint is nothing to the purpoſe. If we did, Miracles are not here wanting, <hi>viz.</hi> The change of Mens Lives either from good to better, or at leaſt from bad to good: which ſufficiently proves the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spirit appearing, above all your fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:106095:138"/>Exceptions. And if other Miracles are neceſſary, thoſe are many times granted too.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 126. <hi>Was it not a worthy piece of the Angelical Miniſtration, for Angels to go trot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting over Sea and Land, with a Load of Timber and Stone of the Virginal Houſe to</hi> Loretto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whether they <hi>trotted,</hi> or <hi>ambled,</hi> I doubt not, but that <hi>piece of Miniſtration</hi> was more pleaſing to thoſe Bleſſed Spirits, than to attend the protection of Men, who ſpend their Strength of Body and Mind in offending God, by <hi>impugning known Truth.</hi> Sin I know they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor; other things are indifferent to them; and all are welcom, when commanded.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 128. <hi>The Miracles of</hi> Rome <hi>are not heard of till ſome Ages, at leaſt Years, be paſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is not true. They are all very ſtrictly immediately examined by Authority from the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> and then publiſhed. See that done at <hi>Gant</hi> upon <hi>D. Mary Minſhall,</hi> approved by the Biſhop ſhortly after it paſt.</p>
               <p>G. B. ibid. <hi>It is the Intereſt of</hi> Rome <hi>to have them all believed, without once queſtioning them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Rome</hi> has no Intereſt, but that Truth find place, and God be glorified. If you conſider how ſtrictly thoſe of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Nun were examined, and how ſincerely the Cheat was publiſhed, you will acknowledge, that our Church doth not countenance any Deceit in this, nor think it her <hi>Intereſt,</hi> that <hi>all ſhould be believed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>G. B. ibid. <hi>How comes it, that in Heretical
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:106095:138"/>Countries, where there is more need of thoſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and where they might be more irrefragably proved, if true, none of thoſe mighty Works do ſhew themſelves forth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> How comes it, that when the Scribes and Phariſees demanded a Sign from Heaven, our Saviour refuſed it? <hi>An evil and adulterous generation ſeeketh after a ſign, and there ſhall no ſign be given to it.</hi> Mat. 12.39. It is preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for you, or any other, to preſcribe Rules to God Almighty's Providence, which is never wanting in what is neceſſary, and we ought not to expect things unneceſſary, to pleaſure our Curioſity either in Nature, or Grace; which he grants when he pleaſes, but not always. Now Miracles are very efficacious Means, but not the only Motives to bring us to Faith, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence not abſolutely neceſſary. The Apoſtle had a Power to work Miracles, and had a great proportion of Learning, yet he uſed neither for Converſion of the World, when worldly Men demanded it. <hi>Judaei ſigna petunt, Graeci ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientiam quaerunt. Nos autem praedicamus Chriſtum Crucifixum, Judaeis quidem ſcandalum, Gentibus au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ſtultitiam.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.22. <hi>The Jews require a ſign, and the Greeks ſeek after wiſdom.</hi> And did he work <hi>Miracles</hi> to ſatisfie the one, or uſe <hi>Human Wiſdom</hi> to work on the other? No, <hi>But we preach Chriſt crucified, a ſcandal to the Jews, and folly to the Greeks.</hi> Both tempted God, as the Scribes did, and you do: and neither obtained what they demanded. Indeed, thoſe that will
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:106095:139"/>ſhut their Eyes to all other Motives, would eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baffle the conviction of Miracles, either ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are natural Works, or attributing them to Magick. You ſee how the Cure of the blind Man, born ſo, was toſſed, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 9.) and how caſting out Devils (<hi>Luc.</hi> 11.15.) was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to their Prince, <hi>Beelzebub.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 133. <hi>My greateſt Quarrel at theſe Forgeries of Miracles, is, that the People are taught to believe them and the Miracles of the Goſpel, with equal certainty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If this be the only ground of your <hi>Quarrel,</hi> we ſhall quickly agree; for I do not believe them with equal certainty. We are bound to believe with <hi>Divine Faith</hi> each <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> related in the Goſpel, but not ſo thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, how authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſoever.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Our Body by certain degrees grows up from the Dimenſions it is born with, to its full Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and our Mind, from its native Ignorance ſucceſſively paſſes to Knowledge. Give <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> his Works to a Novice in <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> he will not be the better for them. He muſt be firſt prepared to receive benefit by them, by paſſing <hi>Euclid's Elements.</hi> The ſame of other Sciences: and one may learn to read <hi>Hebrew without Points,</hi> without learning his <hi>Aleph, Beth,</hi> as well as he may learn the <hi>abſtruſer Concluſions</hi> of any <hi>Science,</hi> without learning its <hi>Rudiments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> differs from all other <hi>Sciences</hi> in its Object, that is, God's Veracity, but agrees with them, that it requires ſome time to be brought to its full perfection. It contains many Aſſents to ſeveral Myſteries, or Articles, to whoſe underſtanding we cannot attain at one hearing.</p>
               <p>Nay, each Article requires ſome time; ſo that as the material Sun chaſes away the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of the Night by degrees, riſing on our Horizon: ſo doth the <hi>Sun of Juſtice</hi> ſucceſſively enlighten our Soul. This <hi>encreaſe of Faith</hi> the Apoſtle demanded of our Saviour, <hi>Luc.</hi> 17.5. To this the Prince of the Apoſtles exhorts, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:106095:140"/>the ſincere Milk, that in it you may grow.</hi> 1 Pet. 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. not as your <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Tranſlation hath it, <hi>that you may grow thereby;</hi> as if our <hi>Growth</hi> were only <hi>by Faith in other things,</hi> when it is <hi>in Faith it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Milk</hi> is frequently taken in Scripture by a natural, and very proper Metaphor, for the firſt Rudiments, or neceſſary Principles of <hi>Faith,</hi> communicated to <hi>Catechumens,</hi> or Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who being young, and as it were <hi>Infants in Chriſt,</hi> were not capable of more abſtruſe My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, which are called <hi>ſolid Meat.</hi> So to Babes <hi>Milk</hi> is given, till by uſe of it they get ſtrength to digeſt <hi>ſolid Meat.</hi> This Method the Apoſtles uſed, 1 Cor. 3.1, 2. <hi>I, brethren, could not ſpeak unto you, as unto Spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as babes in Chriſt; I have fed you with Milk, and not with Meat, for you were not able to bear it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet now are ye able: for you are yet carnal.</hi> Here you ſee, Sir, a whole Church, a noble Church, kept for a long time to her <hi>Milk,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her progreſs in Spirituality, did not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the time of her Converſion.</p>
               <p>A like Concluſion may be drawn from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach made to the ancient converted <hi>Jews,</hi> Heb. 5.12. <hi>When for the time ye ought to be teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, you have need that one teach you again, which be the firſt principles of the oracles of God, and are become ſuch as have need of milk, and not of ſtrong meat. For every one that uſeth milk, is unskilful in the word of righteouſneſs; for he is a babe. But ſtrong meat belongs to thoſe that are of full age,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:106095:140"/>thoſe, who by reaſon of uſe, have their Senſes exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed to diſcern good, and evil.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle dealt with <hi>Babes in Chriſt,</hi> but to <hi>Proficients</hi> he diſcovered greater Myſteries; <hi>We ſpeak wiſdom amongſt the perfect,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.6. And becauſe he thought the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> were ſuch, <hi>he prayed hard</hi> daily, that he might ſee them again, that <hi>he might compleat what was lacking in their Faith,</hi> 1 Theſ. 3.10. Now whether this <hi>compleating</hi> was <hi>intenſivè</hi> or <hi>extenſivè,</hi> by adding new My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Faith, or a more ample Explication of what they knew before, is not material.</p>
               <p>This will help us to underſtand the meaning of another place of the Apoſtle, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 12.) <hi>I ſay, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is amongſt you, not to think of himſelf more highly than he ought to think, but to think ſoberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the MEAS<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE of Faith. For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the ſame office; ſo we being many, are one body in Chriſt, and every one members of another. Having then gifts according to the grace which is given us, whether prophecy, miniſtry,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Faith</hi> is diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, you ſee, to all the Church, yet not to each Member alike; but to each one <hi>HIS ME A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE,</hi> proportionable to his Capacity, and the Place, or Function he is called to. Which Similitude he uſes in a like Senſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.7. And had you taught your Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as the Apoſtles did theirs, to be content with their <hi>meaſure of Faith,</hi> there had not been
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:106095:141"/>ſo many Sects in the World; who pretending to the <hi>fulneſs of Faith,</hi> of which they are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, have loſt both <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee, Sir, whoſe Example we follow in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Apoſtles. So if there be any deſign of <hi>Ambition</hi> to ground it, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are guilty of it, not we. <hi>Orig. contr.

And we ſay the ſame.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 132. <hi>Theſe are Practices far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the Method of the Apoſtles in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel, who withheld nothing of the Counſel of God from the People.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe words are taken out of that Speech of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Church of leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> Act. 20.27. which you by a groſs Miſtake ſay were the <hi>People;</hi> as if the Holy Ghoſt had made <hi>the People Biſhops to Govern the Church of God.</hi> Now if the <hi>People</hi> Govern, who are Governed? You are hard put to it, to find Reaſons againſt us, when you are forced to ſuch wretched Shifts. Know then, (which I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any one who reads with attention that place can be ignorant of) that thoſe to whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake there, were Biſhops, to whom by reaſon of their Office, a <hi>larger meaſure of Faith</hi> was due: to them <hi>the whole counſel of God was made known,</hi> to be communicated to others, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly to all; <hi>but to faithful men, who might be able to teach others.</hi> 2 Tim. 2.2.</p>
               <p>Now thô according to the Practice of the Apoſtles, the People amongſt us are not made Teachers, Paſtors, Prophets, and Apoſtles, yet all, even to the meaneſt Artiſan, have <hi>Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons neceſſary to Salvation:</hi> What they are bound to <hi>believe,</hi> what they are to <hi>hope</hi> for, and what to <hi>doe;</hi> And what need of more?</p>
               <p>If any amongſt us will undergo the labor of Studies, the greateſt Myſteries of our Faith are obvious to him: Our Scriptures, our Councils, our Decretals, our Fathers, our Eccleſiaſtical, and Prophane Hiſtories, our Divines, and our Philoſophers, are extant in our Stationers Shops; as well for the uſe of the meaneſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, as of the Pope, Cardinals, or Biſhops.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:106095:142"/>What is then concealed from them, which may ground your Accuſation?</p>
               <p>Our Procedure in this is ſo connatural, that I am perſuaded it cannot but be your own Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church hath drawn to ſome few Heads thoſe Points of Faith which ſhe thinks neceſſary to Salvation, and delivers them to all in her <hi>Catechiſm.</hi> As for the others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained either in the <hi>Bible,</hi> or in the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian Creeds,</hi> or in the four firſt <hi>General Councils,</hi> ſhe leaves it to her Children to ſeek them out themſelves, if they have will and convenience, or to receive them from their <hi>Miniſters:</hi> and I do not ſee how any Governors of a Church can proceed otherwiſe. Dare you blame this in your <hi>Mother Church?</hi> Why then ſhould you condemn us for it?</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 133. <hi>Matters of Intereſt are the conſtant Subject of their Studies and Sermons; whereas others, of the greateſt Laws of God are ſeldom minded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you could write this Untruth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bluſhing, you have no Blood in your Body. To confute you, it will be enough to open any one Book of Devotion, and hear, or read a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. <hi>In malâ cauſâ non poſſunt aliter.</hi> Auguſt.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXIII.</hi> Faith not dependant on Senſes.</head>
               <p>G. B. p. 133. <hi>GOD hath fitted Faith, and framed our Souls ſo harmoniouſly, that they are congenial one to another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I find you in this Point very much to ſeek, how to own a great Truth, and yet to eſtabliſh a contrary Falſhood, which is very dear to your whole Party. That <hi>Faith</hi> is above <hi>Natural Reaſon,</hi> and much more above <hi>Senſe,</hi> is unqueſtionable. This you own, and ſo place <hi>Faith</hi> on a Throne. Yet ſomething muſt be had againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and nothing occurs but from <hi>Senſe.</hi> Then you pull down <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſet up <hi>Senſe</hi> in her place. <hi>Tantae molis erat ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum ſubvertere dogma. The Myſteries about God and Chriſt,</hi> ſay you, <hi>are exalted above the reach of our Faculties: But Reaſon it ſelf teacheth that it muſt be ſo.</hi> Here <hi>Faith</hi> is above <hi>Reaſon.</hi> But afterwards, pag. 134. <hi>Our Faith reſts on the Evidences our Senſes give.</hi> Here <hi>Faith</hi> does Homage to <hi>Senſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith is an argument of things which appear not,</hi> Heb. 11.1. So that it relies not on <hi>Senſes,</hi> for its Object doth not appear; nor on <hi>Reaſon,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it would be <hi>Science,</hi> if the Reaſon be evident, or <hi>Opinion,</hi> if it be uncertain. So it relies only on God's <hi>Veracity,</hi> which conſiſts of two Qualities. One, that He cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:106095:143"/>being Omniſcient; The other, that he cannot deceive, being Good. Neither is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God: for to be deceived, is an Error in the Underſtanding; and to deceive, argues Malice in the Will. So the Aſſurance we have by <hi>Faith,</hi> is greater than that of our <hi>Senſes,</hi> which may be baffled; greater than that of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> which ſometimes is miſtaken in its Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, oftner deceived in its Deductions from them. Thus <hi>God is true,</hi> (Rom. 3.4.) <hi>and every man a lyar:</hi> which later part imports a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Error in our cleareſt Operations, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Senſe</hi> or of <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſay, that <hi>Faith reſts on the Evidence of Senſes,</hi> (as you do p. 134.) is ſo contrary to the nature of <hi>Faith,</hi> that both Divines and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers doubt whether the ſame Object can<note n="*" place="margin">S. Thom. <hi>2.2.</hi> q. <hi>1.</hi> art. <hi>4.</hi> &amp; <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>be ſeen</hi> and <hi>believed;</hi> and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpeaking, deny the poſſibility of it. And to what our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaid, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt ſeen me, thou haſt believed,</hi> Joh. 20.29. They anſwer with S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, Aliud vidit, aliud credidit; He ſaw a Man, and believed him to be God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To what purpoſe then are <hi>Miracles,</hi> if <hi>Faith</hi> doth not rely on them? <hi>Anſ.</hi> To diſpoſe our Underſtanding to receive with attention and ſubmiſſion the Word of God, by ſhewing it was God who ſpoke. And when Chriſt appeals to his Works: (<hi>If I do not the Works of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do not believe me; but if I do them, if you will not believe me, believe the Works,</hi> Joh. 10.38.)
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:106095:143"/>he aſſigns only the outward Motive of <hi>Belief;</hi> by which his Hearers were either drawn to Believe, or made inexcuſable, if they perſiſted in their Incredulity. Now it is the groſſeſt Error imaginable, to think that <hi>Faith</hi> reſts on all thoſe things which diſpoſe to it; otherwiſe it would reſt on the skill in Tongues, which is neceſſary to underſtand the original Scriptures; <hi>Item,</hi> on the Maſters, who Teach them; on the Stationer, who Prints them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what if the Man, who confirms his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by evident Miracles, teach things contrary to <hi>Senſe</hi> or <hi>Reaſon? Anſ.</hi> Our Duty is to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence both theſe, and hearken to him. <hi>The Arms of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, caſting down imaginations, and every high thing, that exalts it ſelf against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought.</hi> 2 Cor. 10. Who ſays, <hi>every thought,</hi> comprehended both thoſe ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>Senſe,</hi> and others more Speculative. But to ſay as you do, that <hi>Reaſon muſt be ſubject to Faith,</hi> but not <hi>Senſes,</hi> is very prepoſterouſly to put <hi>Reaſon</hi> the Miſtreſs, under <hi>Faith;</hi> and <hi>Senſe</hi> the Servant, above it. You declaim againſt <hi>Catholics,</hi> for acknowledging in the whole Church an Authority in order to the <hi>Word</hi> of God, much leſs than that which you give to the <hi>Senſes</hi> of every particular Man. What an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion do you give us, to return upon you all your Declamations?</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 134. <hi>We cannot really doubt, but
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:106095:144"/>things are as they appear to us: for we cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it Midnight when we ſee clearly the Sun in our Meridian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We ſhould not doubt of what God ſays, who (we are ſure) cannot tell a Lye. We perceive daily the Hallucinations of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. I am ſure ſometimes my Senſes are miſtaken, and my Reaſon corrects them. <hi>All Man is a Lyar,</hi> every knowing Faculty in him is ſubject to Deceit. God cannot tell me it is Midnight when it is Noon-day, becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell a Lye: But if God ſhould tell me it is Midnight, and my Eyes ſhould repreſent to me a luminous Body in the Meridian perfectly like the Sun; I ſhould ſuſpect my Eyes, or gueſs I ſaw a Meteor, or that I Dreamed, or Raved, or were yet in a worſe Condition. The leaſt, and laſt of my thoughts would be, that <hi>God told a Lye;</hi> which is the firſt thought you ſuggeſt.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 135. <hi>Senſes unvitiated, fixing on a proper Object, through a due Mean, are infallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Are they more infallible than God? Are we infallibly certain all thoſe Conditions concur? May there not be more ways to delude our Senſes, than are diſcovered? May there not be ſome latent defect in the Organ unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by us? Or ſome want in the Mean? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to theſe Queſtions; and withall tell me, whether you have as great certainty of your Anſwer to theſe Queries, as you have of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity of God.</p>
               <p>With more colour another may ſay, that
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:106095:144"/>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> cannot be againſt <hi>Reaſon;</hi> and with <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> refuſe to believe any thing contrary to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and ſo turn <hi>Antitrinitarian.</hi> I think my ſelf as aſſuredly certain of that Metaphyſical Principle, <hi>Eadem uni tertio ſunt idem inter ſe,</hi> as of any thing I know by Senſes; yet knowing what Chriſt hath taught concerning the Bleſſed <hi>Trinity,</hi> I believe that, and explicate that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple as I can. Why ſhould we not proceed in like manner with our Senſes, when they ſeem to contradict what Chriſt hath taught? We are commanded to <hi>put out an Eye, cut off a Hand, or foot,</hi> (Mat. 18.8, 9.) if it draws us to ſin. What ſhall we do, if they draw us to Infidelity? Or do you think it unlawful to keep them, yet lawful to follow their ſuggeſtions, and deny our Faith in obedience to their Depoſitions?</p>
               <p>Heap up then your Abſurdities, your Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities, your Incredibilities, your Sophiſms againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> to as great a bulk, as your little Studies, and leſs Diſcretion will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, you will only multiply Proofs of the Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Folly of the <hi>Reaſon of Man,</hi> which dares enter the Liſts againſt the <hi>Truth of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 136. <hi>It is little leſs unconceivable, to imagin, that a Man of no eximious Sanctity, nor extraordinary skill in Divinity, ſhould have the Holy Ghoſt at his command, that his Decrees muſt be the Dictates of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I paſs that diſreſpectful Expreſſion, <hi>Having the Holy Ghoſt at his command;</hi> no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic ever ſpoke ſo. Do you think the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:106095:145"/>of the Holy Ghoſt (whence flows all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction both Spiritual and Temporal) is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to only Saints, and Learned Clerks? Doth Prelate and Prince loſe their Juriſdiction by every mortal Sin? Was <hi>Amos</hi> the Shepherd a great Divine? Were <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas</hi> great Saints? Were the Scribes and Phariſees ſuch, whoſe words all (<hi>Mat.</hi> 23.2.) were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to obey at the ſame time that they were warned to avoid their Actions? And that I may give you an Inſtance proportionable to your Objection, of an irrational Creature to an unreaſonable Doubt, what ſay you to <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Aſs? Was he either <hi>Saint</hi> or <hi>Divine? He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked his Maſter for his iniquity, ſpeaking with man's voice, and forbad the madneſs of the Prophet.</hi> 2 Pet. 2.16.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXIV.</hi> Mr. <hi>G. B.</hi> his Intention in his Books, and his Meekneſs to Catholics.</head>
               <p>G. B. p. 140. <hi>TH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S far I have purſued my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, in the Tract whereof I have not been void of a great deal of Pain and Sorrow: for what Pleaſure can any find by diſcovering ſo much Wickedneſs. God is my witneſs, how theſe thoughts have entertained me with horror and regret, all the while I have conſidered them: And it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the greateſt antipathy to my Nature imaginable, that I have paid this Duty to Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here you give a very artificial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of all you had ſaid before: That you undertook this Task with great Reluctance, and carried it on with Grief and Sorrow; Vouch God as Witneſs of the truth of this, ſuſpecting, I ſuppoſe, as you had reaſon, your bare Word would ſcarce be received, whilſt ſo many preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Proofs ſtand for the contrary.</p>
               <p>For Firſt, Your Religion doth not inſpire ſuch a Spirit of Mortification, as to engage her Children in painful and ſorrowful Actions, for any time at all, much leſs for ſo long a time as is neceſſary for compoſing a Book of ſo various Matter. And for your Perſon, I do not hear that you ſeek ſo much occaſions of Grief.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Thoſe who with ſorrow and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs think of others Faults, avoid thoſe
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:106095:146"/>uſually, and entertain others of their Vertues. <hi>Content</hi> is the thing all Men commonly ſeek, even in their Grief. They decline contriſtating Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and ſometime ſeek a freedom from them by a ceſſation from all rational Operations, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the ſottiſh, ſtupid, ſenſleſs Condition of a Beaſt, before the rational, but irkſom thoughts of diſpleaſing Objects; as is too common in <hi>England,</hi> if I am not miſtaken: But that a Man, who may divertiſe himſelf, or find Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments pleaſing, ſhould trouble himſelf with what paſſes in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> or <hi>China,</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> which concerns him not, is very unuſual, and almoſt incredible.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Thoſe who are truly ſorry for their Neighbors Faults, do not eaſily entertain falſe Reports of them; Are unwilling without pregnant Proofs, to harbor any bad Opinion of them, or give credit to bad Reports con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them; In fine, ſhew in their Actions the truth of that ſaying, <hi>Charitas non cogitat malum,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.5. <hi>Charty thinks no evil.</hi> You on the contrary take all malicious Reports againſt us, as true, althô you either knew already, or with a little labor might have known the wrong done us, in them; for as for the greateſt part of your Difficulties, they are ſuch as have been Anſwered over and over.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, You feign things your ſelf, which no body ever dreamt of, and are in themſelves moſt untrue. As what you ſay pag. 133. <hi>The Subject of our Sermons and Studies are Matters of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:106095:146"/>Intereſt, and not the Laws of God.</hi> Nay, when the things themſelves are not blame-worthy, you calumniate our <hi>Intentions,</hi> ſeeking into our Hearts for matter to fix a Calumny on. And can any body perſuade himſelf, our Errors and Faults afflict you, when you labor ſo hard to find them? And feign them your ſelf rather than miſs of them? I cannot <hi>tell to what better to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this Proceeding</hi> (if your Grief were real) <hi>than to Children, who having dreſt up a Puppet, fancy it ſick, then dead, and then fall a crying, as if it really were ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Your manner of Writing is too ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial for Grief: it is not ſo ſerious and grave as thoſe are which that Paſſion dictates. It is ſarcaſtical, inſulting, ſharp, biting, in a word, ſatyrical, no ſign of mercy, compaſſion, bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, bewailings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but only when you call to mind your Text, or ſtrive to get your Readers Favor, by pretending to grieve for our Faults: So that, did you not tell us of it, we ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gueſs any other Paſſion predominant in you, than that of Grief. We find many clear Signs of <hi>Pride, Emulation, Hatred, Contempt, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Diſdain, Jealouſie, Fear,</hi> &amp;c. and but few of <hi>Sorrow.</hi>

               <p>Laſtly, This very Proteſtation gives an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſuſpect your Innocency, according to the Rule of the Law, <hi>Excuſatio non petita, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatio manifeſta; An Excuſe not demanded, is an evident Accuſation.</hi> An Apology is always an Anſwer to ſome Reproach of a Crime; and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:106095:147"/>when no Witneſs appears abroad, who made that Reproach, it is certainly ſuſpected to be objected by the beſt Witneſs, the Man's own Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Hence, I fear, moſt indifferent Readers will think, that you never gave greater ground to ſuſpect your Ingenuity, than now. It is a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to attend to good Words, when we ſee bad Actions; to regard <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Voice, when we feel <hi>Eſau</hi>'s Hands. You very religiouſly <hi>call God to witneſs,</hi> but I believe he will ſcarce confirm your <hi>Depoſition</hi> with a <hi>Miracle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Intentions</hi> are ſecret, known only to the <hi>Searcher of Hearts,</hi> it is a raſhneſs for any to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to know them even by Conjectures. And althô you preſume to diſcover the <hi>Deſigns</hi> of Men dead many Ages ago, yet I will not imitate you in that Raſhneſs, by pretending an Inſight into your Heart, how great ſoever may the ground be for a gueſs. I will not <hi>return evil for evil;</hi> I will be as civil, and favorable to you, as I can: I admit you thought you ſaid <hi>True</hi> when you writ this, and that if you deceive us, it is after being deceived your ſelf: for althô you ſpoke an <hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruths,</hi> the honeſteſt Man in the World may tell them, no <hi>Honeſty</hi> exempting him from miſtaking things of himſelf, or being miſinformed from others; and ſo he may tell an <hi>

               <p>Now this poſſibility of Miſtakes, and Error, reaches to our Hearts, which are hidden not only from our Neighbors, but even from our ſelves, whilſt we take Thoughts for Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and tranſitory Purpoſes for ſetled Deſigns. S. Greg. l. 1. Paſtor. c. 9. <hi>Saepe ſibi de ſe mens ipſa mentitur, fitque ut aliud in imis intentio ſuppri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat, aliud tractantis animo ſuperficies cogitationis oſtendat: &amp; fingit de bono opere amare quod non amat, de mundi autem gloriâ non amare quod amat. Our Soul is often deceived by her ſelf,</hi> ſays S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory. <hi>What ſwims on the ſurface of the Mind, is far different from what lies at the bottom of the Heart,</hi> (which hath the main part in our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) <hi>ſome are entirely poſſeſt with the love of the Vanity of this World, who think they love God.</hi> So that God alone knows amongſt all thoſe Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we have in our Wills, which is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and as for our ſelves, we are often miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and, as <hi>Thomas à Kempis</hi> ſays, <hi>think we are moved with Zeal, and it is only Paſſion which tranſports us. Saepe paſſione movemur, &amp; zelum putamus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You had then two Paſſions in your Soul, when you writ this Book, the one ſwimming on the ſurface of your Mind, (as S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeaks) of <hi>Grief</hi> for the ſuppoſed <hi>Errors</hi> of the <hi>Catholic Church.</hi> The other hidden at the bottom of your Heart, of <hi>Hatred</hi> of <hi>Papiſts.</hi> The firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled you to make your <hi>Proteſtation;</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond (except in ſome very few places) governed your <hi>Intention.</hi> Now to your <hi>Meekneſs.</hi>

               <p>G. B. pag. 142. <hi>My deſign is to provoke Pity, rather than Wrath, and Tears more than Flames, towards thoſe deceived Multitudes, that we may Pray for them, rather than Rail at them.</hi>

               <p>OUR Bleſſed Saviour (<hi>Mat.</hi> 7.15.) watns us to <hi>beware of thoſe who come to us in
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:106095:149"/>ſheeps-clothing, but are interiorly ravenous wolves;</hi> and gives us a ſign to know them by, <hi>their works.</hi> Catholics conſidered the Works of the firſt Reformers, and by them judged of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whether they were <hi>Sheep,</hi> or <hi>Wolves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Imprimis,</hi> They had a great Motive to ſuſpect the whole <hi>Reformation,</hi> becauſe the occaſion of it was evidently reproachful. In <hi>Germany, Luther</hi>'s Motive was Emulation betwixt his Order, and the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> and Envy, that theſe later ſhould have the Preaching of the Jubilee. In <hi>England,</hi> Luſt began it under <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and Avarice, and Pride compleated it under <hi>Edward</hi> VI.</p>
               <p>By whom was it moſt hotly embraced, and promoted? By Apoſtates, in whom the Fleſh prevailed over the Spirit: and the firſt Step they made, was ſhaking off the Yoke of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their lawful Superiors, to become <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant.</hi> This is one Sacrilege, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with two others, breaking their Vows of <hi>Chaſtity</hi> and <hi>Poverty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What Motives did they uſe, to draw People to joyn with them? Propoſe Liberty from all Eccleſiaſtical Laws, that were any way burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, or contrary to Senſuality, as Faſting, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on certain Days, Penances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> freeing Men from the Obligation of Divine Laws, by teaching they were impoſſible, and rejecting ſome of them in particular, as that for <hi>Confeſſion.</hi> Indulging Senſualities, trampling on all that ſeemed burthenſome, under pretence of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:106095:149"/>
               <p>What Effects followed the <hi>Reformation?</hi> A neglect of God's Counſels, an inſenſibility of his Inſpirations, a contempt of Religion, an unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to be Ruled, Rebellion in Church and State, a loſing of the Spirit of Prayer, a ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all good Works, and an entire abandoning themſelves to bad ones; The Light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel promiſed, and that darkned with irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Interpretations; The Word of God held forth, and a great part of it cut off; A Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation pretended in the Church, and the Church robbed of its Revenues; The Church-Worſhip purged, and the chief Action of it, <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed; The Glory of God promiſed, and his Sacred Name by Blaſphemy prophaned; <hi>Faith</hi> ſo commended, as by it <hi>Hope</hi> was deſtroyed by <hi>Preſumption,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> by <hi>Schiſm.</hi> In fine, if any thing like Zeal appeared in the firſt Times of Reformation, it ſhewed it ſelf by Avarice, Rapine, Sacrilege, Pride, Diſſenſions, Schiſms, Rebellions, Incontinences, Drunkenneſs; in a word, Libertiniſm. Which the ſincerer part of your Communion deplore with true Tears; not with ſuch as you ſhed for our Errors. If theſe are <hi>works of ſheep,</hi> what are the <hi>works of wolves?</hi> And if by <hi>works we muſt judge of men,</hi> what could they ſay of theſe <hi>Reformers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us lay aſide what is paſt, and look on what is preſent. Is it not true, that thô you talk much of Chriſtianity, yet all Marks of it ſeem blotted out of the Lives of your Flock? That there never was more Impurity in Marriages,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:106095:150"/>more Corruption in Families, more Debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery in Youth, more Ambition amongſt the Rich, more Pride amongſt the Gentry, more Diſhoneſty in Commerce, more Sophiſticati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Merchandiſes, more Deceit amongſt Tradeſmen, more Intemperance amongſt all? That Fornication is thought a Peccadillo; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, good Fortune; Chaſtity, a Reproach to the Sex; Cheating and Treachery, Court Vertue; Impiety and Libertiniſm, Strength of Wit; Oaths and Blaſphemies, Ornaments of our Language; Perpetual Gaming, a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Divertiſement for Men; Contempt of their Husbands, Neglect of the Education of their Children, and of the Care of their Families, a Privilege of Women who have ſome advantage of Birth, and Fortune; And Drunkenneſs, for all who have Time and Mony to caſt away? The prodigious numbers of Houſes deſigned for Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, is a ſufficient convicton of the greatneſs of this Vice: there be more in <hi>London</hi> alone, than in any ten Catholic Towns in <hi>Europe,</hi> and probably more than ſerved the whole Kingdom in Catholic Times; which are ſo many Nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Idleneſs, whence all Vices flow; and the thriving Condition they all live in, ſhews which way the Riches of the Nation go, and on what their Hearts are ſetled.</p>
               <p>You will ſay theſe are Faults of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> but not of the <hi>Reformation.</hi> But in this you are miſtaken; for it comes from the very ſubſtantial Parts of your <hi>Reformation:</hi> ſo that
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:106095:150"/>if any do well, it is to be attributed to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Nature; if ill, it is to be charged upon your Religion, which hath retrenched, on ſeveral Pretences, almoſt all Helps of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
               <p>Chriſt, to apply to us the Merits of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, inſtituted ſeven Sacraments, which are Adminiſtred in the Catholic Church. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate us, <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> To ſtrengthen us in Faith, <hi>Confirmation;</hi> To nouriſh our Souls, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt;</hi> To reſtore us to God's Grace, if by frailty we have loſt it, <hi>Penance;</hi> To prepare us for a Paſſage to the other World, <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction;</hi> To confer Grace neceſſary for a Churchman or a Married Man, <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony.</hi> Of thoſe you have cut off five; and of the two remaining, that of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> which Chriſt ſaid was his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> you make only a bit of Bread, and a Spoon-ful of Wine.</p>
               <p>The Catholics have every day the unbloody Sacrifice of the Altar offered, at which they can aſſiſt; they are taught that <hi>Maſs</hi> is compoſed out of the Law, and Prophets, the Goſpel, and Canonical Epiſtles; That it is a Summary of the Life of Chriſt, and Commemoration of his Death; That when they ſee the Sacred Hoſt elevated, they muſt call to mind his Elevation on the Croſs for their ſakes; and that they muſt offer him, and themſelves with him, to God the Father, as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> teaches us, <hi>lib.</hi> 10. <hi>de Civit.

               <p>Ceremonies in Divine Service are neceſſary to fix our Fancy on the things in hand, and to help to raiſe our Soul to God. This they do firſt by their Signification, as knocking our Breaſt is a ſign of Grief, and Contrition; Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Bowing, of our Adoration of God; Lifting up our Hands and Eyes to Heaven, of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our Wills to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe within us thoſe Diſpoſitions they ſignifie, by a ſympathy betwixt the Soul, and Body. Theſe you have retrenched, as Superſtitious, which hath opened a Door to the Contempt of your Holy Service, and Places, where it is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, to which many of you ſhew little more Reſpect, than at other Civil Actions; nay, many would not enter into a Friend's Houſe with ſo little Reſpect as they ſhew, entring into the Houſe of God.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Tis true, nay it conſiſts in one thing, (as to its perfection) <hi>The Love of God above all things.</hi> But what then? Are helps to ſtir up that Love of God to be neglected? It is Phariſaical to place our Confidence in the Ceremonies, or conſider them as the Subſtance of Religion; but to look on them as its Ornaments and Means to ſtir up, and ſtrike good Purpoſes deeper into our Hearts, why ſhould it be miſliked? The
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:106095:151"/>wiſer of your Brethren in <hi>France</hi> acknowledge, and bewail the want of them; ſo will you, if you conſider it well.</p>
               <p>Catholics have an unqueſtionable <hi>Ordination:</hi> for if we have none, yours muſt fall to the ground, you having received yours from us. Yours is not only queſtionable, but queſtioned actually, and with ſeeming probability denied by Catholics. 1. For want of a due Miniſter, a Biſhop. 2. For want of due Matter and Form. 3. For want of due Intention; for your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops owning no <hi>Sacrifice of the new Law,</hi> could not intend to confer a Power to offer <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which is eſſential to <hi>Prieſthood.</hi> They were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in their opinions of your want of <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> by your owning Communion with thoſe Reformed Churches in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> which have no lawful <hi>Ordination</hi> according to your Principles; your directing yours to their Churches, adviſing them to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from them; and admitting thoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to the Miniſtry among you, without any new <hi>Ordination.</hi> This is confirmed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain all ſuch Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as being admitted to the Communion of the Catholic Church, deſire to enter into Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. She <hi>(the Church of Rome)</hi> condemns Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, as a Sacrilege, and never practiſed it. Hence the Prieſts of the <hi>Greek, Armenian,</hi> and <hi>Cophtic</hi> Communion, renouncing their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Errors, are admitted to Officiate, without
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:106095:152"/>any new Impoſition of Hands in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe Orders are validly conferred in thoſe ſeveral Churches. The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> would be in a like manner admitted, had there not been a certainty from the beginning of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validity, or nullity of their Orders.</p>
               <p>To conclude, they had thoſe ſame Motives to continue in the Communion of the Catholic Church, which S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> had; which he relates lib. contra Epiſt. Fundam. cap. 4. <hi>Tenet conſenſio populorum &amp; gentium, tenet auctoritas miraculis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choata, ſpe nutrita, charitate aucta, vetuſtate fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata: tenet ab ipſa Sede Petri cui paſcendas oves poſt Reſurrectionem Dominus commendavit, uſque ad praeſentem Epiſcopatum ſucceſſio Sacerdotum. Tenet poſtremò ipſum Catholicae nomen, quod non ſine cauſâ inter tam multas haereſes ſic iſta Eccleſia ſola obtinuit, ut—Apud vos autem, ubi nihil horum eſt, ſola perſonat veritatis pollicitatio.</hi> 
                  <q>I am retained in the Catholic Church, by the Conſent of Nations, by an Authority begun with Miracles, nouriſhed with Hope, encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Charity, eſtabliſhed by Antiquity.

But they found this very <hi>Goſpel,</hi> this <hi>Scripture,</hi> pronounce in their favor, and againſt you. <hi>This is my Body,</hi> ſays the Scripture; <hi>It is not Chriſt's Body,</hi> ſay you. <hi>The Commandments of God are not heavy,</hi> ſays the Scripture; <hi>The Commandments of God are impoſſible,</hi> ſay you. <hi>A reward is due to our good works,</hi> ſays the Scripture; <hi>No works of ours are meritorious; nay the beſt are ſins,</hi> ſay you. <hi>Faith without works is dead,</hi> ſays the Scripture, and you commend <hi>Faith,</hi> ſo as to make all <hi>good works</hi> be neglected. I grant ſome amongſt you of late, do not ſo crudely teach ſome of theſe Doctrins, being aſhamed of their deformity. But you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, but that they were taught by the firſt <hi>Reformers.</hi> Which was ſufficient to convince the World, that Scripture gave no evident Verdict for them; and make all afraid of their <hi>Reformation,</hi> who had a care of their Souls.</p>

O that you did but ſee with what Attention and Reſpect they aſſiſt at thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Myſteries; how with their Knees on the Ground, their Eyes on the Altar, their Heart in Heaven, they accompany the Prieſt, and with
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:106095:153"/>him jointly make that Oblation to God, with what. Sentiments they adore Chriſt preſent, and deſire him to appeaſe his Father's Wrath, for their Sins, by the Merits of his Paſſion; and preſerve them from offending anew that Day, and to bleſs that Days Actions! What do <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants?</hi> As ſoon as they are up, they have their Hand in the Cupbord, &amp; in the Cup their Noſe.</p>
               <p>Have any by mortal Sins ſhut againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Gates of Heaven, which the Paſſion of Chriſt opened; they ſtir up a real Sorrow for that Offence of God, purpoſe Amendment, and with theſe Diſpoſitions addreſs themſelves to a Prieſt, with a Reſolution to follow his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and perform what he ſhall enjoyn. They diſcover to him all the wounds of their Soul, their moſt ſecret and moſt reproachful Sins, as to God himſelf, whoſe Vicegerent he is, being aſſured of an inviolable Secret, (and it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a perpetual Miracle, that amongſt ſo many thouſands of Prieſts, not one ſhould be found faulty in this Point): They hearken to his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, accept his Penance, to Faſt, Pray, give Alms, viſit Priſoners, ſerve Poor in Hoſpitals, or the like, according as the Condition of the Penitent permits: Then receive Abſolution in vertue of the Power given by our Saviour to Prieſts, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.23. The Effects of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are Remiſſion of Sins paſt, avoiding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, making Reſtitution, if any thing hath been taken (as ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>France</hi> have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced.) In fine, a newneſs of Life. Of all
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:106095:154"/>this, what is in uſe among <hi>Proteſtants?</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>Are they judged fit to approach the Divine Table, they do it with a <hi>lively Faith,</hi> believing it is the true, real, and ſubſtantial Body of Chriſt, with his Blood, and Divinity, <hi>per conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitantiam</hi> (Concil. Trid. Seſſ. 13. cap. 13.) <hi>by reaſon of the inſeparable <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion betwixt them.</hi> With a <hi>profound Humility;</hi> profeſſing with the Centurion, (<hi>Luc.</hi> 7.6.) their unworthineſs to receive their Lord, and deſiring him to make them worthy. And with a <hi>Love</hi> proportionable to that Chriſt ſhewed by inſtituting this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. What do <hi>Proteſtants?</hi> Sometimes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: for their Miniſters diſtribute a Morſel of Bread, and a Sup of Wine, and they may expect to meet only with Diſpoſitions proportionable to thoſe <hi>Beggerly Elements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amongſt us, <hi>Is any ſick? He calls for the the Prieſts of the Church, they pray over him, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointing him with oyl in the Name of the Lord, that the Prayer of Faith may ſave the Sick, and God may raiſe him up,</hi> (in caſe it be for the Glory of God, and the good of the Patient) <hi>and if he have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Sins, they may be forgiven him.</hi> Jac. 5.14, 15. Thus in an Apoſtles words I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered our Practice in Adminiſtring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction.</hi> Of which <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> nothing.</p>
               <p>Beſides <hi>Maſs,</hi> which all hear every Day commonly, three times a day a Bell rings, to mind us of the Incarnation of the Son of God,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:106095:154"/>and move all with an Act of Faith, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, and return God thanks for it. Of which amongſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> nothing.</p>
               <p>I may conclude this Compariſon betwixt you and us, as to the Practice of Piety, with S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s words, (<hi>Lib. de moribus Eccleſ c.</hi> 34.) very pat to our purpoſe: <hi>Iſtis, Manichaei,</hi> (Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantes) <hi>ſi poteſtis, obſiſtite, iſtos intuemini, iſto's ſine mendacio, ſi audetis, &amp; cum contumeliâ nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Iſtorum jejuniis veſtra jejunia, caſtitati ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitatem, veſtitum veſtitui, epulas epulis, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiam modeſtiae, charitatem charitati, &amp; quod res maximè poſtulat, praeceptis praecepta conferte. Jam videbitis, quid inter oſtentationem &amp; ſinceritatem, inter viam rectam &amp; errorem interſit. Nunc vos illud admoneo, ut aliquando Eccleſiae Catholicae ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledicere deſinatis, vituperando mores hominum, quos &amp; ipſa condemnat, &amp; quos quotidie tanquam ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los filios corrigere ſtudet. Sed quiſquis illorum bonâ voluntate, Deique auxilio corriguntur, quod ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerunt peccando, poenitendo recuperant. Qui autem voluntate mala in priſtinis vitiis perſeverant, aut addunt graviora prioribus, in agro quidem Domini ſinuntur eſſe, &amp; cum bonis ſeminibus creſcere, ſed veniet tempus, quo zizania ſeparentur.</hi> 
                  <q>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them well, ſee whether, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending againſt Truth, you can reproach any thing. Compare your Faſts, with ours: your Chaſtity, your Modeſty, and chiefly your Doctrin, with ours; you will preſently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what difference there is, betwixt vain boaſting, and ſincerity; going the ſtraight
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:106095:155"/>way, and wandring. At preſent I adviſe you, to ceaſe from detracting from the Catholic Church, blaming the Lives of Men whom ſhe condemns, and whom ſhe daily endeavors to correct, as naughty Children. If any of them with the help of God's Grace are converted, they recover in the Catholic Church by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, what they loſt by Sin. If any not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all theſe helps to Piety, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue obſtinate in their Wickedneſs, or add more grievous Sins to thoſe they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, they are indeed tolerated in the Field of God, the Church, until the time come de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the ſeparation of the Cockle from the good Corn.</q> Thus S. <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Glory then as much as you pleaſe with the lukewarm <hi>Laodicean</hi> Angel, <hi>That you are rich, and encreaſed in Goods, and want nothing;</hi> yet aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your ſelf, that as he, ſo you <hi>are poor, and wretched, and miſerable, and blind, and naked.</hi> Your boaſting of the Advantages of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and Diſcipline amongſt your deluded Admirers, is like thoſe Nurſes, who wanting Milk, entertain their Children with Rattles and Bibs, and ſome inſignificant Nourriture. In reality there ſeems to be as much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Spiritual Food Souls receive in the Catholic Church and that of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as there is betwixt the Nourriture a Child receives ſucking a Breaſt ſtretched with Milk. and that he gets by ſucking a moiſtned Finger.

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XXXVII.</hi> No Houſes of Devotion, nor Spiritual Books amongſt Proteſtants.</head>
               <p>G. B. p. 145. A <hi>Temptation to become</hi> Papiſts, <hi>is the ſolitary and retired Houſes among them for leading a devout, and ſtrict Life, and the many excellent Books of Devotion have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by many of that Communion.</hi> And pag. 147. <hi>I deny not that is the greateſt defect of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that there are not in it ſuch Encouragements to a devout Life.</hi> And pag. 148. <hi>It is not to be denied to be a great Defect, that we want Recluſe Houſes: But it fixeth no Imputation on our Church, her Doctrin, or Worſhip, that ſhe is ſo poor, as not to be able to maintain ſuch Seminaries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is as pretty a Sophiſm of <hi>non cauſa pro cauſâ,</hi> as I have ſeen. As if the ſmall number of Engliſh <hi>Catholics,</hi> were richer than the whole Body of <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> for we have founded many great Families of Religious, and you with all your Induſtry could never ſettle one. There are Reaſons for your Church's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo unſucceſsful in theſe Attempts, without doubt, as real, and true, as that which you give is falſe: and it ſhall be my work to lay them out before you.</p>
               <p>The Firſt, and chiefeſt Reaſon, is a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God Almighty upon you, for breaking up, and diſperſing ſo many Houſes of Piety.
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:106095:156"/>God was ſerved in thoſe Houſes, he was offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that Sacrilege, and therefore denies you that Bleſſing of which you are unworthy.</p>
               <p>A Second, Each one had rather keep his Means to himſelf, than ſee them paſs againſt his will to another Lay-Family, for whom he hath no kindneſs. If any give it to God, and Religion, they deſign it ſhould continue there, which cannot be expected in <hi>England,</hi> as long as the Memory is freſh of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Third, The Foundation of your <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is inconſiſtent with a Superſtructure of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or living in Community together. Men cannot live together without a ſetled <hi>Rule,</hi> or <hi>Order,</hi> eſtabliſhed, peculiar to that manner of Life, and proper for it. Your <hi>Reformation</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with this, it teaching to reject all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Injunctions, as contrary to <hi>Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi> When out of that Principle you have taught Men to deſpiſe all Decrees, even of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, received by the whole Church, and confirmed by the Practice of many Ages, how can you hope they ſhould eſteem Rules gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by modern new Men?</p>
               <p>A Fourth, Your Doctrin denying all Merits, or Reward, due to our Actions. Hopes of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage encourages us to Labor: our Induſtry is dull'd as ſoon as thoſe vaniſh. S. <hi>Ambr.</hi> thinks the <hi>Novatians</hi> unreaſonable, who preached Penance, and denied the Fruit of it, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Poenit. c.</hi> 16. <hi>Fruſtra dicitis vos praedicare Poenitentiam, qui tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litis,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:106095:156"/>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Merendi gratia Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti, ad precandum impellimur: &amp; hoc auferre vultis, propter quod agitur Poenitentia? Tolle gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernatori perveniendi ſpem, &amp; in mediis fluctibus incertus errabit. Tolle luctatori coronam, &amp; len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus jacebit in ſtadio: Tolle piſcatori capiendi effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciam, deſinet jactare retia.</hi> In hopes of arriving at his Haven, the Pilot ſteers his Ship; The Wreſtler ſtrives, in hope to throw his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; The Fiſher caſts his Nets, in hope of catching ſome Fiſh. All theſe would relent, were they perſuaded the thing they aimed at were impoſſible. How then do you expect, that Men ſhould practiſe good Works, when you teach them to hope for no good from them? It were indeed to be wiſhed, that Men would ſerve God, for God, without regarding any Reward: But that is a Perfection all do not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to; and even the beſt are fain to uſe ſome other Motives.</p>
               <p>A Fifth, Your Clergy is utterly unfit to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and Inſtruct ſuch Houſes: our Works have a greater influence on our Neighbors, than our Words. S. <hi>Jerom</hi> thought it incongruous, that a Man, with a <hi>full Belly</hi> ſhould Preach <hi>Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> And how can a Man Preach Chaſtity to others, who comes himſelf from the Embraces of his Wife, if he hath one, or hath his Head full of Amourettes, and Deſigns to get one, if he be a Batchelor?</p>
               <p>It is in vain therefore that you ſeek the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of thoſe withdrawing Places, from the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:106095:157"/>noiſe, and trouble of the World, to thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Solitudes: your Lives are not fit for them, your Doctrin is inconſiſtent with them, and your paſt Actions have ſhut that Door of Mercy unto you.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Books of Devotion,</hi> the Author of the <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> ſays, you have Printed ſeveral ſuch, compoſed by ours, under your own Names: So you hang us, and cheriſh our Writings, as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtoned the Prophets, and canonized their Books. You own we <hi>have many excellent Books;</hi> all the World ſees you have ſcarce any, nor can rationally hope for any. For, he who writes a Spiritual Book, ought to aim at two things. The Firſt, to inſtruct the Underſtanding with Divine and Eternal Truths. The Second, to move the Will to a Hatred of Sin, a Contempt of the World, and to the Love of God above all things. The firſt may be an Effect of Study; but the ſecond cannot be attained unto, unleſs the Author be ſuch himſelf. He muſt, as S. <hi>John,</hi> be <hi>A burning and ſhining Light,</hi> Joh. 5.35. <hi>Burn</hi> to God, by a true and unfeigned Love of him; <hi>Shine</hi> to Men, by the clear Truths, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers. He muſt feel within himſelf thoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which he endeavors to communicate to his Reader. <hi>Si vi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s me flere, dolendum eſt primum ipſi tibi.</hi> A Soul poſſeſſed with Hope, with Fear, with Joy, with Grief, with Love, with Hatred, in fine, with any Paſſion, doth expreſs not only the Thoughts, but the Paſſion it ſelf with Tropes proper: by which means it not only informs
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:106095:157"/>the Underſtanding, but alſo ſtirs the Will of the Hearer, or Reader, to like Inclinations.</p>
               <p>Read <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Epiſtles, or other Moral Works, or <hi>Cicero</hi>'s, you ſhall find a great many excellent Truths; yet I never knew any Man the better in his Morality for them: As they themſelves, notwithſtanding thoſe Lights, were far from being <hi>Good Men,</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Lactantius, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Divin. Inſtit.</hi> from Chap. 13. On the contrary, the reading of Saints Works hath a great force to move us to Good. S. <hi>Auſtin, l.</hi> 8. <hi>Confeſſ. c.</hi> 6. ſays ſome were Converted by reading the Life of S. <hi>Antony.</hi> Several have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſerious Reſolutions of leading a Chriſtian Life by reading thoſe <hi>Confeſſions.</hi> And I have known ſeveral moved to love Mental Prayer, by reading <hi>S. Tereſa's</hi> Works: and to the Love of God, by uſing thoſe of <hi>S. Francis de Sales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a great defect in all our <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Writers. I will inſtance in two, who ſeem each in his kind to overtop his Confreres, <hi>quantum lenta ſolent inter viburna Cupreſſi.</hi> The one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> who by Diviſions and Subdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions inſtructs well, only ſometimes <hi>verborum minutiis rerum pondera frangit.</hi> The other is the Author of <hi>The whole Duty of Man;</hi> who hath many excellent Truths, and very practical, as well as the firſt: yet ſeem not to move the Will, becauſe of their cold way of treating their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins. <hi>They ſhine,</hi> but they do not <hi>Burn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Heat is not to be attained unto but by Prayer. Which enflames our Heart with the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:106095:158"/>Love of God, (<hi>In meditatione meâ exardeſcet ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> Pſal. 38.4.) It is this Love, which unites us to God: and this Union makes us capable of doing great things. For an Inſtrument muſt be in the Hand of the Workman, to do compleatly what is intended: if it be diſtant from him, and not held, but by a ſmall Thred, the Work will be difficult and imperfect, if there can be any. We are all the Inſtruments of God in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to all good Works, eſpecially in writing Spiritual Books, in which, if there be any thing good, it muſt come from God, the Fountain of all Good.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles after the <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> expecting the coming of the Holy Ghoſt, (<hi>Act.</hi> 1.14.) <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with one accord in Prayer.</hi> S. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> althô ſanctified in his Mothers Womb, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the Office of <hi>Praecurſor,</hi> and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence fitted from above for that Office, yet he <hi>was in the Deſert till the days of his ſhewing unto Iſrael,</hi> (Luc. 1.80.) ſequeſtring himſelf from the company of Men, and converſing only with God and his Angels, the far greateſt part of his Life. And the Word Incarnate, not for any need of his own, but to give us Example, paſſed Forty days in Faſting and Prayer in a Deſert before he began to Preach, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.2. And when he had begun, he paſſed the Days with Men, and the Nights in Prayer with his Heavenly Father, (<hi>Luc.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Erat pernoctans in oratione Dei.</hi>) <hi>Species tibi datur, forma tibi praeſcribitur, quam debeas amulari,</hi> ſays S. <hi>Ambr. l.</hi> 6. <hi>in Luc.</hi>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:106095:158"/>This was the Practice of S. <hi>Greg. Naz.</hi> S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> S. <hi>Chryſoſtom.</hi> And in later Times, <hi>Ignatius de Loyola,</hi> before he began the Society, paſt a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat in a Cave at <hi>Manreſa.</hi> God alone is in peculiar manner the <hi>Father of Lights,</hi> all is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but what is received from him. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Spiritualiſts that ever held a Pen, even the Writers of Scripture, at the ſame time they taught us, received their Leſſon from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt. And firſt the Ears of their Heart were open <hi>to hear what God ſpoke to them,</hi> Pſal. 84.9. Then they opened their <hi>Mouth, to ſpeak out of the abundance of their Heart, to us.</hi> Mat. 12.34.</p>
               <p>Now what Years, what Months, what Weeks, or at leaſt Days, do you of the Miniſtry paſs in Solitude in Prayer? I find little footſteps of it in any of your Works: and when you fall upon thoſe things, you diſcover you are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to them, for you advance like one, who gropes to find his way in the dark. You have ſome Terms of Scripture, of <hi>Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Lord, Walking with God,</hi> and the like, which you uſe on all occaſions: which are in themſelves very ſignificant, but very inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant to you, becauſe not underſtood by you. I never found any, who could practically expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them, ſo as to be tolerably underſtood. Indeed there are in Scripture many things not to be underſtood, but by Prayer. Such is that Saying of our Saviour, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 12.25.) <hi>He that hateth his Soul:</hi> which S. <hi>Francis Xaverius</hi> uſed
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:106095:159"/>to ſay, was dark in <hi>Study,</hi> but clear as noon-day in <hi>Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Humility</hi> is neceſſary in a Spiritual Man, God being pleaſed <hi>to reveal his Myſteries to the little ones, when he conceals them from the proud and wiſe,</hi> Mat. 11.15. They are thoſe Inſtruments, which God chiefly uſes: For <hi>God chooſes the weak things, to confound the ſtrong; and the fooliſh things, to confound the wiſe; the baſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible things, to confound the proud, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence.</hi> 1 Cor. 1. Now this Vertue is a Flower ſcarce to be found in your Garden.</p>

               <p>FROM your pag. 149. to the end, making a Panegyrick of the pretended Reformed Church, you deſcribe rather an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, than it, or if it, rather what it ſhould be, than what it is. You own ſome ill Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you; yet ſay, pag. 153. <hi>Their bad Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices are no ground to quarrel the Doctrins.</hi> Which is very true, (provided your <hi>Doctrins</hi> do not foſter thoſe <hi>bad Practices</hi>); for I readily own, it is no reproach to any Congregation, to have ſome ill Men diſcovered in it, (there ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never been any without ſome) provided neither its Eſtabliſhed Laws do abet the Evil,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:106095:159"/>nor its Doctrins diſpoſe to it. I know (<hi>Auguſt. Epiſt.</hi> 137.) that in the Ark of <hi>Noe</hi> one, <hi>Cham,</hi> was accurſt; That out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family <hi>Iſmael</hi> was caſt; That in <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Family <hi>Eſau</hi> was hated; In <hi>Jacob</hi>'s <hi>Reuben</hi> defiled his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Bed; In <hi>David's</hi> one Son committed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt, another turned Rebel; That amongſt the Apoſtles there was <hi>Judas</hi> a Traytor; That in Paradiſe <hi>Adam</hi> fell, and in Heaven that ſome Angels ſinned. Our Bleſſed Saviour teaches us, that in the Church there are fooliſh, as well as wiſe Virgins; In the Field, Cockle with good Corn; In the Barn-floor, Chaff with Wheat; In the Net, bad with good Fiſhes. This being agreed to on both ſides, our only Queſtion muſt be, The Doctrins of which Church do foſter Impiety, or ill Lives? You ſay ours; and I have proved the contrary. We ſay yours; and thus I prove it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Our Will cannot ſeriouſly love, or endeavor to attain to, a thing repreſented as impoſſible. Hence no Man in his Wits will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to make a Ladder, to reach the Moon, nor Boots to wade with, hence to <hi>Jamaica;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by reaſon of the diſtance of the Moon, and the depth and breadth of thoſe Seas, both are looked on as impoſſible. Now in the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Doctrins, the keeping of God's Commandments is eſteemed impoſſible. Wherefore theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins damp all Endeavors to keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, or to live piouſly.</p>
               <p>Two things may be anſwered to this. 1. That
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:106095:160"/>ſome of ours have taught that Doctrin. 2. That ſome of yours do not teach it.</p>
               <p>To the Firſt, I anſwer, That <hi>Janſenius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſeems to hold it; but it was condemned in his Writings, by two Popes; and this Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation received by the whole Church. To the Second, There never was any Decree of thoſe of your Communion againſt that Doctrin; nay, you to this day own Communion with thoſe, who teach it: So the diſcouragement to Vertue and Piety ſeems invincible amongſt you.</p>
               <p>How contrary is this to the Diſcourſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> (Deut. 30.11.) when he told them, the Commands he had impoſed on them, were not of things in Heaven, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Countries; that is to ſay, were neither ſo high, nor ſo remote, as to be out of their reach; but that they were in their Heart and Mouth; or, as eaſie, as to Speak, or Love. To the ſame intent (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3.) the <hi>Commandments of God</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>light.</hi> Conformably to which, the Catholic Church teaches, that it is eaſie to keep God's Commandments, and by this encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage all to endeavor it.</p>
               <p>The two Principles on which we labor, the two Springs of all our rational Actions, are <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear.</hi> Hope of a Reward ſtirs us up to good Actions; Fear of Puniſhment diverts us from forbidden or bad Actions. Theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments are commonly propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to us for that intent, in the Law and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, in the Old and New Teſtament. Now
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:106095:160"/>in the Catholic Church all are taught, that Heaven, or an Eſtate of Eternal Bliſs, is due to good Actions, by the Merits of Chriſt, and in virtue of the Promiſe of God; and that good and virtuous Actions are meritorious of it through Chriſt our Saviour. And that Hell is the Lot of ſuch, as offend God mortally, and die in ſuch a State.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Proteſtants</hi> theſe two Conſiderations are ineffectual: for they teach, no Reward is to be hoped for, for any good Works, the very name of <hi>Merit</hi> being ſcandalous to their tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences: And no Puniſhment due to bad Works, (except Infidelity) Faith aſſuring to them an Act of Oblivion, their General Pardon, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their Life may have been.</p>
               <p>Who will ſeriouſly combat his Paſſions, break his own ſinful Will, deny himſelf all ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even in forbidden things, who is perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he ſhall never be the <hi>better</hi> for living fully up to the ſtricteſt Doctrin of the Goſpel, nor the <hi>worſe</hi> for living contrary to it?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Humility is an eſſential Ingredient of Piety, or a vertuous Life. By Pride we fell, (and ſo did the Angels) by Humility we muſt be reſtored. Hence our Bleſſed Saviour commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, as a Maſter to teach us, and a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern ſet to us, of a vertuous Life, particularly mentions this Vertue: <hi>Learn of me,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for I am meek and humble of heart.</hi> Now what ſign of this Vertue amongſt the <hi>Reformed?</hi> I hear ſay, never any of their Miniſters compoſed any
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:106095:161"/>Treatiſe of this ſo great, ſo neceſſary, ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a Vertue. That one was publiſhed indeed, but it was only a Tranſlation out of <hi>Rodriguez</hi> a Jeſuit; a thing not unuſual, to Print the Works of ours in their own Names, as <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> obſerves. What eſteem have you for this Vertue, of which you never treat?</p>
               <p>Indeed the Foundation, or Baſis of your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> is Preſumption, or Pride, it being grounded on a preference of their Judgment, in underſtanding, and explicating Scriptures, (a thing of as great difficulty, as concern) before that of lower and higher Paſtors of the Church, whether taken ſeverally, or aſſembled in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, or even General Councils: Before thoſe Biſhops, whom the Holy Ghoſt hath <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Govern the Church which he purchaſed with his own Blood,</hi> Acts 20.28. Before thoſe <hi>Paſtors and Doctors</hi> whom Chriſt gave <hi>to conſummate the Saints, that we might not be like children carried hither and thither, with every blaſt of Doctrin.</hi> Epheſ. 4.11, &amp; 14. Before thoſe to whom Chriſt ſaid, <hi>He that hears you, hears me; and he that deſpiſes you, deſpiſes me.</hi> Luk. 10.16. Before thoſe, in fine, whom Chriſt ſent <hi>to inſtruct all People,</hi> promiſing <hi>he would be with them to the end of the world.</hi> Mat. 28.19. What Pride, what Preſumption, bating that of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> greater than this? What room for <hi>Humility,</hi> in a Soul ſo full of it ſelf, ſo puffed up with vain Conceits of its own Capacity? And what hopes of any real Vertue without it; ſeeing it is the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:106095:161"/>ſureſt, and only foundation of a pious Life?</p>
               <p>This laſt Reaſon ſhews, that in your Souls there is no Foundation for a Structure of Piety: and the others ſhew, you can hope for no Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture upon any Foundation.</p>
               <p>Another Doctrin of yours, as pernicious as any of the reſt, is, That the beſt of our Actions are Sins, even our Endeavors to ſerve God, keep his Commandments, and give to every one his due, <hi>viz.</hi> paying a Debt, or relieving the Poor. Nay, it ſeems a greater Sin to do it, than not to do it; Sins of <hi>Commiſſion</hi> being more grievous, and offenſive, than thoſe of <hi>Omiſſion.</hi>

               <p>G. B. pag. 154. <hi>We cannot be charged, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taught our People to break any one Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

               <hi>POSTSCRIPT</hi> TO Mr. CUDWORTH D. D.</head>
            <p>I Had ended the whole Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> before I had the ſight of your Learned great Book againſt <hi>Atheiſm;</hi> which gives me occaſion to clear and confirm ſome Points, which I thought then, and think ſtill clear and ſtrong enough, notwithſtanding all the Miſt you, and others have raiſed, to hide them, and their Endeavors to ſhake them. But as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle was, ſo <hi>I am a debtor not only to the wiſe, but to the unwiſe too.</hi> Which Debt I hope to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge in few Lines.</p>
            <p>You own, that ſome few Philoſophers, as <hi>Epicurus, Strato,</hi> &amp;c. thought God to be Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal; but that the major part believed him to be a pure Spirit, and adored the <hi>Only true God</hi> under the Names of <hi>Jupiter, Minerva, Oſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, Neith,</hi> or <hi>Venus.</hi> I ſaid, with the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Primitive Chriſtians, that althô <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi> and indeed all Men, had a natural know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>One God;</hi> yet thoſe, the <hi>Pagans</hi> ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, had been Men. The Proofs then produced,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:106095:163"/>I reduce to four Heads. The Firſt taken <hi>from the Diverſity of their Sexes.</hi> The Second, <hi>from their Generation.</hi> The Third, <hi>from their Death.</hi> The Fourth, <hi>from their Sacred Rites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The different Sexes of the Pagan Gods,</hi> is a convincing Proof, that they were not <hi>Spirits,</hi> but <hi>Men,</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> at leaſt <hi>Males,</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males,</hi> and by conſequence <hi>Corporeal.</hi> This Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon takes up a great part of <hi>Arnobius</hi>'s Third Book, from pag. 46. which he begins with theſe words: <hi>Adduci primùm hoc ut credamus, non poſſumus, immortalem illam, praeſtantiſſimam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Naturam, diviſam eſſe per ſexus.</hi> He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us there, that <hi>Cicero</hi> having ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly profeſſed his diſlike of this, the <hi>Pagans</hi> endeavored to get his Works aboliſhed by the <hi>Senate,</hi> becauſe they implied a diſlike of <hi>Ancient Paganiſm,</hi> and an approbation of <hi>Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin. Oportere ſtatui per Senatum aboleantur ut haec ſcripta, quibus Chriſtiana Religlo comprobetur; &amp; vetuſtatis opprimatur Auctoritas.</hi> So eſſential were theſe <hi>Sexes</hi> to the <hi>Pagan Deities.</hi> Which being deſigned only for carnal Propagation, brings on my</p>
            <p n="2">2. Reaſon. Thoſe Gods received their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from Parents, as Men do. This is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently evidenced out of <hi>Ovid. l.</hi> 4. <hi>Faſt.

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:106095:163"/>which <hi>Venus Ovid</hi> ſpeaks of in that Verſe? You ſay, it is the <hi>Divine,</hi> or <hi>the true God:</hi> I ſay it is the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> and thus I prove it: That <hi>Venus,</hi> who makes Males Fight with one another, and ſport with the Females of their Kind; for whom young Men break their Sleeps, to give Serenades to their <hi>Miſſes:</hi> who by Adultery with <hi>Anchiſes</hi> brought forth <hi>Aeneas;</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with <hi>Pallas</hi> and <hi>Juno</hi> for a <hi>Golden Apple,</hi> and ſubmitted to the Judgment of <hi>Paris;</hi> who Fought in defence of <hi>Troy,</hi> and was wounded; She, I ſay, was the <hi>Vulgar Venus,</hi> and not the <hi>True God;</hi> which, I ſuppoſe, needs no Proof. But of this <hi>Venus Ovid</hi> ſpeaks: for he ſays,
<q>

            <p>Thus <hi>Ovid.</hi> Againſt all this, for your Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation you bring <hi>Euripides</hi> in <hi>Stobaeus,</hi> and <hi>Boetius,</hi> who ſpeak of the <hi>Celeſtial Love.</hi> What
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:106095:164"/>then? The Divines, the Fathers, the Scripture, ſpeak of it too; for they ſpeak of the Holy Ghoſt. But what is that to <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Verſe, which they do not mention, and of which alone is our Diſpute? Whence 'tis evident, that all <hi>Pagan Deities</hi> were born as others. As alſo that</p>

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:106095:164"/>theſe things were forbidden to <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the old Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.6. and to all <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Deut. 4.1. Hence the <hi>Poet</hi> very judiciouſly inferred, that <hi>Oſyris</hi> had been a Man: <hi>Quem tu plangens hominem teſtaris Oſyrim.</hi> And your ſelf applaud the common Check of <hi>Pagans,</hi> uſed by <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> but taken out of <hi>Yenophanes</hi> the <hi>Colophonian: If they are Gods, why do you lament them?

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oſyris</hi> is by you taken for the <hi>True God;</hi> yet Hiſtories ſay he was a Man, Brother to <hi>Iſis,</hi> killed by her Husband <hi>Typho,</hi> for Inceſt with her, his Body cut in pieces, and ſcattered about. That ſhe, with the help of <hi>Anubis,</hi> either the Captain of her Guards, or chief Huntſman, found them all again, excepting one part, which Modeſty ſhould have hindred her from ſeeking, as it does me from naming. Yet ſhe grieved ſo much for that loſs, that to comfort her in her Sacred Rites, her Prieſts ſhewed her a Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of it, as if they had found it. <hi>Oſyris</hi> then was a Man; ſo was <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> as well as <hi>Quirinus,</hi> and <hi>Flora.</hi>

            <p>You make <hi>Neith</hi> another Name of the <hi>True God: Arnobius, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 60. will teach you another Leſſon, that ſhe was a Woman, born at <hi>Sais, Ex coeno, &amp; gurgitibus coagulata, prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque</hi> limoſis, compoſed of the filthy Mud of <hi>Nylus,</hi> on whoſe Banks <hi>Sais,</hi> her native Town, ſtood.

We Chriſtians ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by our Prayers, and Penitential Works, of the true God Mercy, and you Pagans aſcribe it to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>'s <hi>Goodneſs, and your Sacrifices to Idols. In which you are miſtaken; for you draw nothing but Miſeries on your Countries, by deſpiſing God, and adoring Statues. Vos malorum ilices ſemper, apud quos Deus ſpernitur, &amp; ſtatuae adorantur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In your whole Book you ſeem to ſuppoſe, that the <hi>

And <hi>p.</hi> 28. he ſays, <hi>Prophets were given to the Jews, to hinder their falling into Pagans Polytheiſm.</hi> And <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 155. he ſays, that the <hi>Wiſe Men,</hi> or <hi>Philoſophers, fell from the Cult of One God, into Impious, or Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical Polytheiſm.</hi> He told us in his Firſt Book, pag. 51. that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> fled from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Chalcis,</hi> to avoid the Fate of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who had been condemned, for teaching there was but <hi>One God.</hi> And it is as evident out of <hi>Athenago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:106095:166"/>and others, that <hi>Chriſtans</hi> were deemed <hi>Impious,</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> for denying <hi>Polytheiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When you intend to pleaſure the Learned part of the World, with any more Learned Works, I adviſe you in the firſt place, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether a thing be true; and then how that Truth may be uſeful to ſome farther diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of a new, or confirmation of an old Truth. <hi>Veritas fulciri non quaerit auxilio Falſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi> Greg. lib. 11. Moral. cap. 15. which is no where more certain, than in Revealed Truths: <hi>Non indiget Deus noſtro mendacio, ut pro illo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quamur dolos,</hi> Job 13.7. You thought, doubtleſs, that to repreſent, that all <hi>Religions,</hi> and all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Laws,</hi> had owned <hi>One God,</hi> would be a <hi>Choak-Pear</hi> to <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and confound the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts:</hi> whereas this being not true, it hath a contrary effect. The other part is much more cogent, drawn from Fathers, that all Men have a natural Knowledge of <hi>One God,</hi> and that ſo deeply imprinted in their Soul, that maugre all the pleaſant Fables of the Poets, the Pomp of Ceremonies and Religious Rites, the Force of bad Education, the Sophiſms of Philoſophers, the Blaſphemies of wicked Men, the Strength of Laws, the Rigor of Torments, the Terror of Death, and the Wiles of the Devil, it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevered, and ſo poſſeſſed the Heart, as in ſome Occaſions to force its Profeſſion out of the Mouth. Certainly this Voice of Nature, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing over all the Force and Art of Men and Devils, is a clearer <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of <hi>One God,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:106095:167"/>his Poſſeſſion in, and over his Rational Creatures, and controlling all adjectitious No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than any Demonſtration <hi>Man's Wit</hi> can invent: Eſpecially ſome <hi>Atheiſts</hi> laboring to weaken this Argument, from the <hi>Notion of a Deity,</hi> by ſaying that <hi>Idea</hi> is not of <hi>Nature,</hi> but raiſed by <hi>Education,</hi> and <hi>Human Laws.</hi> Which <hi>Plea</hi> is evidently defeated by that <hi>Truth,</hi> that <hi>Laws, Religion,</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom</hi> were once againſt it, and all concurring to promote the Opinion of <hi>Many Gods,</hi> thô all in vain.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I adviſe you, not ſo eaſily to draw from a reſemblance in <hi>Name,</hi> or <hi>Number, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Errors</hi> to the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Faith.</hi> With what little ground you drew from <hi>Jupiter</hi> the Name of <hi>God,</hi> hath been ſeen pag. 451. You ſay the <hi>Roman</hi> Capitol was Dedicated to the <hi>Bleſſed Trinity,</hi> becauſe a Poet ſaid, <hi>Trina in Torpaeo fulgent conſortia Templo,</hi> viz. <hi>Jupiter, Minerva,</hi> and <hi>Juno.</hi> And pag. 454. (ſo it ſhould be, thô it be marked 414.) you find the <hi>Trinity</hi> in <hi>Agypt,</hi> viz. <hi>Eicton, Memphta,</hi> and <hi>Oſyris.</hi> You might as well find the ſame My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in the <hi>Three Graces, Three Parks, Three Gorgons, Three Furies, Three Judges, Three Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Three-headed Cerberus, Three-bodied Geryon,</hi> if that number be ſufficient for it. I doubt not, but the Myſtery was revealed in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor that ſome <hi>Platonicks</hi> knew it; S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> aſſures they did, thô he doth not acquaint us in what Age theſe lived; ſo they may have learnt it from the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Yet I think it moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:106095:167"/>that there never was any Temple Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or Sacrifice Offered by <hi>Pagans</hi> to the <hi>Three Divine Perſons;</hi> for out of the Scripture I have learned, that <hi>What they ſacrificed, they ſacrificed to Devils, and not to God.</hi>
